While these are technically themes, and I'm not sure if you'd really want to ban these types of posts, it really isn't that creative or interesting, and has caused my interest in this subreddit to wane a bit. I'm not really sure what the solution to this issue would be, as there already aren't that many posts to the subreddit, and if only really creative themes were allowed there would be like one post a week.
