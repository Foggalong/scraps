Jul 02 18:23:56 <lf94>	Joom: someone linked it to /r/linux, maybe that's why it's gaining popularity

Jul 02 18:26:18 <pico>	Title: patches - gapless grid | suckless.org dwm - dynamic window manager (at dwm.suckless.org)
Jul 02 18:26:23 <Joom>	this might be useful

Jul 02 18:28:44 <lf94>	Guys go the full pragmatic route, eliminate all space wasting widgets and code
Jul 02 18:29:19 <ElTimablo>	Go full minimalist. Remove all widgets and code.
Jul 02 18:29:34 <springworm>	widgets? what is this, windows?
Jul 02 18:29:35 <Joom>	just work in a TTY with tmux
Jul 02 18:29:36 <lf94>	Remove the computer.
Jul 02 18:29:37 <ElTimablo>	Ultra-minimalism is leaving your computer off all day.
Jul 02 18:29:38 <shix>	guys write your C without making spaces
Jul 02 18:29:43 <Joom>	lol
Jul 02 18:30:19 <lf94>	It's really nice having my full 15.1" laptop monitor available
Jul 02 18:31:25 <lf94>	For those who missed the link to my sexy setup earlier: http://i.imgur.com/Lqxi7lT.png
Jul 02 18:31:33 <vilni>	Joom: thanks! i appreciate it

Jul 02 18:32:55 <springworm>	lf94: you can set your term to different backgrouond based on focus?
Jul 02 18:33:43 <napalm>	lf94: Wow the editor. What is it even?
Jul 02 18:34:03 <Joom>	oono or something
Jul 02 18:34:15 <lf94>	^
Jul 02 18:34:26 <lf94>	OONO - Object-Oriented Non-Obstructive Text Editor
Jul 02 18:34:38 <lf94>	springworm: what
Jul 02 18:34:42 <lf94>	No it's just black
Jul 02 18:34:52 <springworm>	oh and the others are just editors
Jul 02 18:34:54 <springworm>	i see
Jul 02 18:34:56 <lf94>	xterm, will be replaced by my own soon enough
Jul 02 18:35:18 <napalm>	oooh, I tought you styled your editor so hard it just looked like a terminal :p
Jul 02 18:35:27 <vilni>	lol
Jul 02 18:35:32 *	ChanServ sets mode +a on #unixporn ElTimablo
Jul 02 18:35:36 <lf94>	It has proportional text, how could it be a terminal? :)
Jul 02 18:35:51 <vilni>	wizardry
Jul 02 18:36:15 <lf94>	My terminal will have proportional text though
Jul 02 18:36:24 <lf94>	Which means no support for curses applications
Jul 02 18:36:36 <lf94>	(curses is a hack anyways)
Jul 02 18:36:39 <napalm>	I don't know it was just so weird :p 
Jul 02 18:36:44 <napalm>	no offence ofcourse
Jul 02 18:36:48 <lf94>	Yeah yeah no problem
Jul 02 18:37:17 <lf94>	It's super powerful for 300 lines of python
Jul 02 18:37:22 <lf94>	I've been using it for 3 months
Jul 02 18:38:30 <lf94>	It's such a pleasure to read code in
Jul 02 18:40:31 <lf94>	Works on any platform that supports Python 3
Jul 02 18:40:31 <napalm>	where does it compare to?
Jul 02 18:40:49 <lf94>	It's most comparable to Acme
Jul 02 18:41:44 <lf94>	If you'd like to try it, just run: `hg clone https://bitbucket.com/lfallat/oono-text-editor`
Jul 02 18:41:52 <napalm>	and where does Acme compare to? I'm sorry never used both
Jul 02 18:42:04 <lf94>	Uh, it compares to nothing
Jul 02 18:42:05 <lf94>	heh
Jul 02 18:42:09 <napalm>	oh ok
Jul 02 18:42:14 <napalm>	but i'll just try offcourse
Jul 02 18:42:16 <lf94>	It's pretty unique :)
Jul 02 18:42:29 <lf94>	You should try Acme first
Jul 02 18:42:37 <lf94>	You need dwm to get my tiling setup
Jul 02 18:42:40 <lf94>	or any other tiling wm
Jul 02 18:42:44 <napalm>	I have i3
Jul 02 18:42:58 <lf94>	Alright go for it :)
Jul 02 18:43:14 <napalm>	i'm doing it!!!
Jul 02 18:43:19 <lf94>	To start it, just type `t [files...]`
Jul 02 18:43:38 <napalm>	yeah i'm going to clone it first
Jul 02 18:43:41 <napalm>	have no mercurial
Jul 02 18:43:43 <lf94>	It's meant to be used in unison with a terminal
Jul 02 18:43:44 <lf94>	Ok
Jul 02 18:44:00 <lf94>	there is zero documentation so that's why I'm saying all this lol
Jul 02 18:44:07 <lf94>	I end up repeating myself a million times
Jul 02 18:44:19 <lf94>	But I don't mind because it reminds me what I need to do to improve it
Jul 02 18:44:40 <lf94>	t is just a script
Jul 02 18:44:53 <lf94>	if you want to create a file that doesn't exist, you'll have to use `touch` to create it
Jul 02 18:45:09 <lf94>	I need to add a little shell script in the `t` script to do this automatically
Jul 02 18:45:28 <lf94>	it works out nicely anyways, because I just do:
Jul 02 18:45:44 <napalm>	ok i'll figure it out man. I will ask questions when i need them. Your explanation is a bit overwhelming :p
Jul 02 18:45:58 <lf94>	Ok ok ok :)

Jul 02 18:47:24 <lf94>	napalm: nice
Jul 02 18:47:34 <lf94>	If you want to change the font and colors, it's really easy
Jul 02 18:47:41 <napalm>	edit the code? :p
Jul 02 18:47:43 <lf94>	Yeah :)
Jul 02 18:47:50 <lf94>	It's just a bunch of constants
Jul 02 18:47:55 <jmbi>	Joom: true dat
Jul 02 18:47:56 <lf94>	You'll see them at the beginning
Jul 02 18:47:57 <napalm>	oh nice
Jul 02 18:48:11 <Joom>	what's been going on?
Jul 02 18:48:43 <jmbi>	rebelling against Neo of course

Jul 02 18:50:04 <lf94>	Ah ok
Jul 02 18:50:25 <napalm>	ok technically I have a student job now that involves programming
Jul 02 18:50:32 <lf94>	Nice :)
Jul 02 18:50:36 <lf94>	Co-op/Intern?
Jul 02 18:50:45 <lf94>	What are you doing there
Jul 02 18:50:50 <lf94>	C#, Java?
Jul 02 18:50:52 <napalm>	I'm creating an app
Jul 02 18:50:54 <napalm>	in cordova
Jul 02 18:50:59 <lf94>	Oh sick
Jul 02 18:51:00 <napalm>	html, js and php for backend
Jul 02 18:51:01 <Joom>	neat
Jul 02 18:51:06 <lf94>	gg
Jul 02 18:51:12 <jmbi>	shix: haven't seen you in awhile mange
Jul 02 18:51:16 <lf94>	Cordova/Phonegap is pretty awesome
Jul 02 18:51:25 <napalm>	and also i have to configure the server where the backend will run on :p
Jul 02 18:51:29 <napalm>	it's really everything
Jul 02 18:51:39 <jmbi>	Joom: I'm glad to hopefully have the drama behind us and move on
Jul 02 18:51:45 <lf94>	Yeah sounds like a nice internship
Jul 02 18:51:46 <jmbi>	and just fucking rice
Jul 02 18:52:19 <lf94>	jmbi: rice this mang: http://i.imgur.com/Lqxi7lT.png
Jul 02 18:52:40 <lf94>	ultimate rice game over ok logout
Jul 02 18:52:43 <Joom>	jmbi, same. Reason why I didn't give into dcat's tryhard attempt last night.
Jul 02 18:52:51 <shix>	^
Jul 02 18:52:55 <shix>	sup jmbi 
Jul 02 18:52:55 <jmbi>	what did he try last night?
Jul 02 18:52:56 <NeoTerra>	^^
Jul 02 18:53:06 <napalm>	lf94: no it's not. Someone from my family works there and he knew I could write software so from one thing came another and i'm now there for 2 weeks
Jul 02 18:53:12 <NeoTerra>	jmbi he wants to host the unixporn irc on his box
Jul 02 18:53:14 <NeoTerra>	apparently
Jul 02 18:53:19 <Joom>	this place isn't affiliated with UH, nixers, or anywhere else other than /r/unixporn and now /r/linux apparently
Jul 02 18:53:33 <lf94>	napalm: ohhhh, ok. Only 2 weeks? damn short.
Jul 02 18:53:48 <lf94>	You must have experience with cordova already then
Jul 02 18:53:57 <jmbi>	Joom: I'm glad that is the case
Jul 02 18:54:02 <shix>	not sure how we were able to fill this place up in some hours
Jul 02 18:54:09 <shix>	didn't think itd get this big lul
Jul 02 18:54:19 <lf94>	I swear it's that /r/linux post
Jul 02 18:54:20 <Joom>	neither did I really
Jul 02 18:54:23 <jmbi>	I lel'd hard at the drama post on the github
Jul 02 18:54:25 <lf94>	That's the only reason why *I'm* here
Jul 02 18:54:29 <napalm>	lf94: It's not that big of an application. And no none in cordova actually. I do in js en html so it doesn't matter :p. But I was there one time already and wrote some code already at home 
Jul 02 18:54:39 <jmbi>	"lul and nigga talk"
Jul 02 18:54:42 <Joom>	jmbi, oh yeah, that was mainly the cause of bosko
Jul 02 18:54:43 <lf94>	Oh ok
Jul 02 18:54:49 <NeoTerra>	bosko <3
Jul 02 18:54:56 <lf94>	2 weeks to design an application and implement it is pretty short
Jul 02 18:55:06 <jmbi>	bosko fucked everything up :P
Jul 02 18:55:10 <shix>	yeh bosko is still doing lulz
Jul 02 18:55:10 <lf94>	But if you've already got a start I guess that explains that
Jul 02 18:55:23 <Joom>	shix, usually shit I try to get going flops quickly. This caught on better than I expected.
Jul 02 18:56:15 <Joom>	whatever
Jul 02 18:56:16 <napalm>	lf94: It's also not big or complex. It just reads some data and that's all. 
Jul 02 18:56:23 <Joom>	makes me feel accomplished
Jul 02 18:56:30 <jmbi>	woop
Jul 02 18:57:13 <jmbi>	ElTimablo: Foggalong: thank you for reviving my favorite subreddit
Jul 02 18:57:59 <lf94>	Did /r/unixporn actually go down?
Jul 02 18:58:31 <Joom>	No, it just kinda became inactive
Jul 02 18:58:39 <Joom>	and full of numix
Jul 02 18:58:43 <jmbi>	^
Jul 02 19:00:03 <NeoTerra>	yo Foggalong take this shit down, no point in hashing up old drama https://github.com/unixporn/info/blob/master/drama.md
Jul 02 19:00:05 <pico>	Title: info/drama.md at master · unixporn/info · GitHub (at github.com)
Jul 02 19:00:24 <Joom>	yeah, I was gonna suggest that
Jul 02 19:00:40 <Joom>	it just provokes more rather than quelling it
Jul 02 19:01:10 <shix>	^
Jul 02 19:01:17 <jmbi>	it does
Jul 02 19:01:23 <NeoTerra>	well especially an article that contains are strung together list of half-truthes to begin with
Jul 02 19:01:31 <NeoTerra>	*a strung
Jul 02 19:01:45 <jmbi>	so much stuff wrong
Jul 02 19:02:08 <Joom>	Like I told dcat last night, past drama is irrelevant to this place
Jul 02 19:02:16 <Joom>	No sense in bringing it up and keeping it alive
Jul 02 19:02:18 <jmbi>	that's good
Jul 02 19:02:31 <NeoTerra>	it really is, idk why Foggalong (who isn't involved in UnixHub or nixers) is even writing about it
Jul 02 19:02:35 <NeoTerra>	let it gooo
Jul 02 19:02:50 <lf94>	To be honest i liked his article
Jul 02 19:02:56 <lf94>	very informative
Jul 02 19:03:01 <shix>	that article was lulz

Jul 02 20:46:27 <pree-sister>	I've been using it forever
Jul 02 20:46:37 <Joom>	cause content isn't hosted on the direct pomf server
Jul 02 20:46:51 <napalm>	lf94: sure, I'm thinking of rewriting the configure function so it reads everything from a file for easy configuration
Jul 02 20:47:29 <Foggalong>	He mentions in the pomf.se FAQ that the site has ended up on blacklists because people were uploading virus' and copyrighted content
Jul 02 20:47:48 <Joom>	Yeah
Jul 02 20:47:57 <pree-sister>	that was like a year ago
Jul 02 20:48:01 <Joom>	He needs to learn how to filter  by extension
Jul 02 20:48:08 <pree-sister>	and I think the blacklists were individual ips
Jul 02 20:49:16 <Foggalong>	If I have time I'll email the site's dev and ask what the current situation is :)
Jul 02 20:49:50 <lf94>	napalm: you may be able to write a class that just overrides the default configuration function
Jul 02 20:49:57 <lf94>	if you did it that way i'd merge it
Jul 02 20:50:33 <shix>	anyone here like Go
Jul 02 20:50:43 <lf94>	Go is shit Haskell is where it's at
Jul 02 20:50:53 <pree-sister>	Go is the most annoying language ever
Jul 02 20:51:02 <shix>	haskell is hipster shit lf94 
Jul 02 20:51:11 <pree-sister>	I spent 1 hour trying to compile mpdviz which was written in go
Jul 02 20:52:27 <lf94>	shix: how the fuck is it hipster
Jul 02 20:53:22 <Joom>	The Schwarzenegger language could have been cool if it didn't rely on Java
Jul 02 20:53:40 <napalm>	lf94: Ok i'll look into it.
Jul 02 20:56:08 <pree-sister>	anyone know a moderator of /r/wmporn?
Jul 02 21:03:50 <Foggalong>	pree-sister: yrmt
Jul 02 21:03:51 <Foggalong>	why?
Jul 02 21:07:11 <pree-sister>	it's invite-only now
Jul 02 21:08:13 <pree-sister>	are you sure yrmt is a mod?
Jul 02 21:08:38 <pree-sister>	says he's not registered
Jul 02 21:08:55 <NeoTerra>	pree-sister on reddit he goes by MacBeastie
Jul 02 21:09:15 <pree-sister>	ah thanks
Jul 02 21:09:26 <NeoTerra>	np
Jul 02 21:09:57 <Joom>	pree-sister, he's shutting it down
Jul 02 21:10:11 <pree-sister>	oh, damn
Jul 02 21:11:00 <pree-sister>	are .gifs and .webms still not gonna be allowed on unixporn then?
Jul 02 21:11:23 <NeoTerra>	pree-sister from what I know, yes
Jul 02 21:11:34 <NeoTerra>	no gifs or webms
Jul 02 21:11:45 <pree-sister>	someone should make a /r/unixgif or something
Jul 02 21:11:48 <pree-sister>	for animated desktops
Jul 02 21:12:41 <Foggalong>	pree-sister: wmporn is shutting down
Jul 02 21:13:01 <Foggalong>	But I think we're going to add a link flair for "GIF/webm" 
Jul 02 21:13:07 <pree-sister>	that sounds good
Jul 02 21:13:16 <Foggalong>	It seems to be the most unpopular of the rules we've introduced
Jul 02 21:13:31 <Foggalong>	So we'll be putting it to user vote most likely next Monday
Jul 02 21:13:37 <pree-sister>	and that we can only use verified sources
Jul 02 21:13:47 <pree-sister>	*hosts
Jul 02 21:14:35 <Joom>	Would require GFY over GIF
Jul 02 21:14:36 <Foggalong>	That one's here to stay. It already came from a user referendum and 70% voted in favour of an approved hosts list

Jul 02 21:16:05 <pree-sister>	and most .gifs (that I make at least) are under 500kb
Jul 02 21:16:15 <NeoTerra>	you can't please everyone
Jul 02 21:16:35 <Joom>	pree-sister, GFY would be around 12 kb then

Jul 03 10:39:15 <Joom>	oh lembas
Jul 03 10:39:23 <PaljonKaunista>	You watch, in 2 generations my children will perform telekenesis.
Jul 03 10:39:40 <Barcelona>	Lol Joom 
Jul 03 10:39:44 <Barcelona>	I remember that
Jul 03 10:39:57 <Barcelona>	He ran servers from that
Jul 03 10:40:31 <Barcelona>	Man he used to be poor
Jul 03 10:41:17 <Barcelona>	The girlfriend told me to get makeup for her birthday
Jul 03 10:41:30 <Barcelona>	Man that shit is complicated
Jul 03 10:41:40 <Joom>	YOU GOT THE WRONG KIND
Jul 03 10:41:48 <Foggalong>	Morning folks 
Jul 03 10:42:02 <PaljonKaunista>	Never ever ever say "the girlfriend"
Jul 03 10:42:03 <Barcelona>	Lol Well she is better than that
Jul 03 10:42:11 <PaljonKaunista>	Say "my girlfriend" because the former sounds retarded.
Jul 03 10:42:18 <PaljonKaunista>	Foggalong, ah hai
Jul 03 10:42:20 <Joom>	first time trying gnome 3 http://i.imgur.com/wrvZJ.png
Jul 03 10:42:21 <PaljonKaunista>	We have been talking about you.
Jul 03 10:42:30 <PaljonKaunista>	Joom has called you in fact new to the internet and I called you a retarded moralist.
Jul 03 10:42:32 <PaljonKaunista>	What is your defence.
Jul 03 10:42:33 <Barcelona>	At worst, of get burnt toast of something
Jul 03 10:42:47 <Barcelona>	What
Jul 03 10:42:49 <Foggalong>	About me?
Jul 03 10:42:53 <PaljonKaunista>	Indeed so.
Jul 03 10:42:58 <PaljonKaunista>	Rumour has it that you are indeed a moralist.
Jul 03 10:43:00 <Foggalong>	Oh great.
Jul 03 10:43:03 <PaljonKaunista>	Quite so.
Jul 03 10:43:04 <Foggalong>	A moralist?
Jul 03 10:43:10 <Barcelona>	Foggalong
Jul 03 10:43:11 <Joom>	Foggalong, pay no mind
Jul 03 10:43:15 <Barcelona>	Yes
Jul 03 10:43:18 <PaljonKaunista>	Laughing at morlists behind thier back may very well change the wolrd for the better.
Jul 03 10:43:22 <Barcelona>	Just ignore him
Jul 03 10:43:22 <PaljonKaunista>	Joom, ahh, covering your arse eh.
Jul 03 10:43:37 <Barcelona>	He is a bad troll
Jul 03 10:43:40 <Joom>	Not really. I did say he seemed new to the Internet.
Jul 03 10:43:50 <Joom>	Which seems true from first appearances.
Jul 03 10:44:12 <Foggalong>	I am not new to the internet, but I am new to both using IRC seriously and the unixhub/nixers community
Jul 03 10:44:20 <Foggalong>	So it is a fair assumption to make
Jul 03 10:44:36 <Joom>	I mean, it's pointless to try to save face when the truth has been pointed out
Jul 03 10:44:44 <PaljonKaunista>	I agree
Jul 03 10:44:51 <Foggalong>	Joom: me?
Jul 03 10:44:52 <PaljonKaunista>	veracity is my game, nothing les.
Jul 03 10:44:58 <Joom>	Foggalong, no, me
Jul 03 10:45:01 <Foggalong>	Ah :)
Jul 03 10:45:03 <PaljonKaunista>	I*, both of you.
Jul 03 10:45:14 <PaljonKaunista>	Disjunctive pronouns are an affront to HRH's tongue.

Jul 03 10:45:37 <AndChat|185600>	This is why I had a personal bouncer
Jul 03 10:45:58 <AndChat|185600>	So I don't annoy people for pinging out a lot
Jul 03 10:46:00 <Foggalong>	PaljonKaunista: HRH quite frankly doesn't give a shit about how people use the English language
Jul 03 10:46:34 <Joom>	Foggalong, ain't gonna lie. You did try to vindictively try to ban someone just for finding publicly available information and making a statement which shouldn't have bothered you. This is what led me to my assumption.

Jul 03 10:47:39 <Foggalong>	Joom: I did, and that was unfair of me. I will point out though that the "death to unixporn" was bothering me more than anything else
Jul 03 10:48:02 <PaljonKaunista>	Foggalong, yes well, this is more about me than her.
Jul 03 10:48:11 <Joom>	Yeah well, it's obviously not true
Jul 03 10:48:15 <PaljonKaunista>	I simply relish in good grammar and telling people where their grammar does not meet my standards.
Jul 03 10:48:32 <PaljonKaunista>	I find such perfectionism to give similar satisfaction to excellent code or an excellent painting.
Jul 03 10:48:50 <Foggalong>	Joom: given that people in the nixers community (inc. their mods) seem to take him seriously I didn't want to just dismiss it
Jul 03 10:48:51 <PaljonKaunista>	Most of all I enjoy correcting native speakers.
Jul 03 10:49:15 <Barcelona>	Well man
Jul 03 10:49:20 <Barcelona>	It is what it is
Jul 03 10:49:30 <Barcelona>	This is the internet
Jul 03 10:49:34 <Foggalong>	brb
Jul 03 10:49:45 <Foggalong>	Barcelona: indeed it is
Jul 03 10:49:55 <Joom>	Foggalong, meh, bosko is more inclined to side against nixers since Beastie just forks gits and changes a minimal amount of lines, then calls it his own
Jul 03 10:49:59 <Barcelona>	You either lose horribly of you lose painlessly
Jul 03 10:50:15 <Barcelona>	But you lose either way
Jul 03 10:50:20 <PaljonKaunista>	Foggalong, anyway, we are having a dispute, would you care to arbitrate

Jul 03 10:50:34 <pico>	Title: All things Youri (at www.reddit.com)
Jul 03 10:50:49 <PaljonKaunista>	it is my contention that my desktop looks way better than that of Joom, however Joom disputes this and clearly lacks my highly evolved brain to see this.
Jul 03 10:51:04 <PaljonKaunista>	His or her unevolved brain is incapable of processing information as the same speed as mine.
Jul 03 10:51:14 <Joom>	PaljonKaunista, then it should be no contest
Jul 03 10:51:25 <Barcelona>	PaljonKaunista
Jul 03 10:51:27 <Joom>	You are right and I am wrong due to the lack of said brain
Jul 03 10:51:28 <PaljonKaunista>	Clearly the more evolved brain wins.
Jul 03 10:51:29 <PaljonKaunista>	Barcelona, yeh?
Jul 03 10:51:35 <Joom>	Obviously
Jul 03 10:51:36 <Barcelona>	What do you mean?
Jul 03 10:51:47 <PaljonKaunista>	Barcelona, mean what?
Jul 03 10:51:53 <PaljonKaunista>	With the highly evolved stuff?
Jul 03 10:51:59 <PaljonKaunista>	Yeah, that's just nonsense honestly.
Jul 03 10:52:18 <Barcelona>	Is your brain so evolved thay you can see through the maximized chromium window to see all of that jink?
Jul 03 10:52:52 <Barcelona>	And why do you need subreddit updates on a desktop?
Jul 03 10:53:00 <Barcelona>	Go to the subreddit
Jul 03 10:53:26 <Joom>	also holy fuck it's 5 am
Jul 03 10:53:27 <PaljonKaunista>	Barcelona, I'd have to check them all.
Jul 03 10:53:38 <PaljonKaunista>	It actually refreshes every 4 seconds to a new one or something
Jul 03 10:53:42 <PaljonKaunista>	forgot to how many seconds I set it.
Jul 03 10:53:50 <PaljonKaunista>	There are a lot in the list

Jul 03 10:54:03 <Barcelona>	Oh and good thing you can slide a terminal into the screen, thats much more convenient than just opening a terminal
Jul 03 10:54:14 <Joom>	which is a Windows desktop
Jul 03 10:54:32 <Barcelona>	And its a blank terminal
Jul 03 10:54:35 <Joom>	Barcelona, just keep throwing food into the cage
Jul 03 10:54:47 <Joom>	you do a great job as a feeder
Jul 03 10:55:11 <Barcelona>	Now it would be pretty cool to pop a dmesg up, but thats not so cpu friendly

Jul 03 11:06:45 <Joom>	space was never appealing
Jul 03 11:07:07 <PaljonKaunista>	Yes, but StarGate universe is Dark & Edgy and stuff
Jul 03 11:07:14 <PaljonKaunista>	a couple of people trapped on a space ship out to kill each other.
Jul 03 11:07:56 <napalm>	If you like that kind of movies/series pandorum should be a good one for you
Jul 03 11:08:01 <Joom>	Not dark and edgy enough
Jul 03 11:08:50 <napalm>	Joom: It's dark, you just can't see the edges
Jul 03 11:09:28 <PaljonKaunista>	napalm, ah that souns kind of cool.
Jul 03 11:09:32 <PaljonKaunista>	I love shows without heroes.
Jul 03 11:09:40 <PaljonKaunista>	Also, I love saying nigger.
Jul 03 11:09:40 <napalm>	It's a movie
Jul 03 11:09:43 <PaljonKaunista>	Oh
Jul 03 11:09:45 <PaljonKaunista>	I hate films.
Jul 03 11:09:51 <PaljonKaunista>	You can't tell z good plot in 2 hours nigger.
Jul 03 11:10:38 <napalm>	The plot is simple. So it's okay. It's mostly people killing eachother and being paranoid
Jul 03 11:11:01 <PaljonKaunista>	Yeah, that I don't like
Jul 03 11:11:05 <PaljonKaunista>	the plot of SGU is complex.
Jul 03 11:11:20 <PaljonKaunista>	Much like tensor calculus.

Jul 03 12:08:26 <PaljonKaunista>	They told me something like "Wow, your brain is so highly evolved to be able to handle that much conky, I cannot understand it therefore it is ugly" or something like that
Jul 03 12:09:31 <Foggalong>	Huh
Jul 03 12:09:45 <Foggalong>	I don't think there is too much conky there
Jul 03 12:10:03 <Foggalong>	If that's how you work, that's how you work
Jul 03 12:10:15 <Foggalong>	Though the colour scheme doesn't quite work for me
Jul 03 12:10:21 <Foggalong>	Not enough contrast
Jul 03 12:11:18 <PaljonKaunista>	Ah, but it is the coral snake colour scheme, black, white, red
Jul 03 12:11:42 <PaljonKaunista>	Foggalong, it is clear that we moralists have a higher evolved brain than those evil amoral people.

Jul 03 13:08:53 <Foggalong>	Psychiatric conditions can have single identifiable causes, such as a chemical imbalance
Jul 03 13:09:19 <PaljonKaunista>	Except those aren't single identifiable causes
Jul 03 13:09:33 <PaljonKaunista>	a single identifiable cause is _always_ praesent when the condition is there and the condition always follows from it.
Jul 03 13:10:01 <PaljonKaunista>	THe thing with psychiatric conditions is that they have a myriad of different causes each contributing.
Jul 03 13:10:08 <PaljonKaunista>	Rather than a single one.
Jul 03 13:10:16 <Foggalong>	Ah, I see what you mean
Jul 03 13:10:24 <PaljonKaunista>	Which makes it hard to call it an illness rather than a 'personality type'
Jul 03 13:10:41 <Foggalong>	I guess that then depends on what method of categorisation you follow
Jul 03 13:10:59 <bwmc>	well people with aspergers tend to have intense interests and hobbies; mathematics, engineering, physics, cs etc
Jul 03 13:11:12 <bwmc>	and general pursue careers in those fields
Jul 03 13:11:14 <PaljonKaunista>	bwmc, that's not a cause though, not even a sign, but a symptom.
Jul 03 13:11:23 <PaljonKaunista>	Oh wait, that is not a reply to that.
Jul 03 13:12:13 <PaljonKaunista>	Foggalong, well, the thing with traditional medicine is that deceases are not categorized on superficially similar symptyoms like in psychiatry but based on cause. In point, there are like about 80 different forms of dwarghgrowth
Jul 03 13:12:36 <PaljonKaunista>	Even though the symptom is superficially similar, a stunted growth, they are all considered different conditions because they all have a different cause, and thus necessitate a different treatment.
Jul 03 13:12:54 <PaljonKaunista>	Which is how traditional medicine treats conditions, it tries to attack the cause, psychiatry is merely at the stage where it masks the symptoms, and crudely so.
Jul 03 13:13:23 <PaljonKaunista>	Traditional medicine is enterine a room, finding the rotten food int he corner and removing it with a scalpel, psychiatry is spraying perfume but otherwise leaving the rotten food.
Jul 03 13:13:23 <bwmc>	aspergers (and other autism spectrum disorders) can't be treated with medication though
Jul 03 13:13:40 <bwmc>	i have heard of poor cases where people with ASD have been prescribed ADHD meds
Jul 03 13:13:49 <bwmc>	but ofc, its terribly innafective
Jul 03 13:13:57 <PaljonKaunista>	THat's a matter of definition if they are treated with medication or not, technically it is not medication in the strictest definition
Jul 03 13:14:11 <PaljonKaunista>	Because it does not attack the condition itself and actually has a similar effect on people who don't have the condition as well.

Jul 03 15:27:59 *	bwmc has quit (Ping timeout: 187 seconds)
Jul 03 15:29:32 <Gaynigger>	lf94, yiu mean a partial function definition
Jul 03 15:29:47 <Gaynigger>	lf94, guards are actually that.
Jul 03 15:30:11 <Gaynigger>	patterns are to match against the structure of algebraic datatypes, something related but similar, it does not stritly test for the truthness of a condition
Jul 03 15:30:43 <Gaynigger>	Though you can argue that the boolean condition system is a special case of pattern matching as it's essentially matching something against a case of True and False as patterns
Jul 03 15:38:41 <lf94>	Gaynigger: They are actually referred to different terms all over in Haskell, but yes, that is also guards.
Jul 03 15:38:50 <lf94>	And no I don't mean partial function definition

Jul 03 15:39:53 <lf94>	Gah fucking ctrl+w
Jul 03 15:39:58 <lf94>	To be more specific I meant:
Jul 03 15:39:59 <lf94>	 patterns are to match against the structure of algebraic datatypes
Jul 03 15:40:08 <lf94>	Didn't realize that
Jul 03 15:40:58 <lf94>	It certainly clarifies what pattern matching actually is
Jul 03 15:41:28 <Gaynigger>	lf94, piecewise function definition?
Jul 03 15:41:32 <Gaynigger>	That's the other term for it in maths.
Jul 03 15:41:33 <lf94>	Ah ha!
Jul 03 15:41:39 <lf94>	Yeah man that's totally it
Jul 03 15:41:46 <Gaynigger>	Ah well, they mean the same thing.
Jul 03 15:41:54 <Gaynigger>	A partial function is something different though
Jul 03 15:42:48 <lf94>	You are pretty knowledgeable- do you spend a lot of time programming?
Jul 03 15:42:51 <Gaynigger>	lf94, even in a strict language by the way, conditionals are actually not needed.
Jul 03 15:43:17 <lf94>	How do you express x > 1 then
Jul 03 15:43:35 <lf94>	They are needed to some extent
Jul 03 15:43:57 <Gaynigger>	Like, in Caml you you could define: let if_func c x y = match c with | true -> x () | false -> y ();;
Jul 03 15:44:27 <Gaynigger>	if_func :: bool -> (unit -> 'a) -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a
Jul 03 15:44:28 <lf94>	How is that not a conditional
Jul 03 15:44:35 <lf94>	That is just a condition in disguise
Jul 03 15:44:44 <Gaynigger>	It's pattern matching
Jul 03 15:44:58 <Gaynigger>	what I mean is, there is no need for the conditional expression in terms of short-circuit evaluation
Jul 03 15:44:59 <lf94>	Yeah, but pattern matching to simulate a condition
Jul 03 15:45:13 <Gaynigger>	Well, the x () instad of x is the crux.
Jul 03 15:45:22 <lf94>	In other words why are you chopping a tree down with a spoon
Jul 03 15:45:24 <Gaynigger>	If you do it naïvely you execute both branches
Jul 03 15:45:40 <Gaynigger>	A condition in a strict language also serves to control execution
Jul 03 15:45:53 <lf94>	I know what you're getting at, just teasing
Jul 03 15:46:12 <Gaynigger>	Well, I'm just saying that such syntax to control execution need not be primitive
Jul 03 15:46:22 <lf94>	Gotchya
Jul 03 15:46:26 <lf94>	How'd you figure this out?
Jul 03 15:46:39 <Gaynigger>	if you have a syntactic macro system such as in say Scheme, you could define it, it won't be optimal, but it works.
Jul 03 15:46:39 <lf94>	Just sort of happened?
Jul 03 15:46:55 <Gaynigger>	It's an ancient trick, I think Haskell does something similar internally
Jul 03 15:47:04 <Gaynigger>	it essentially wraps everything into zero argument low level functions
Jul 03 15:47:12 <lf94>	You are quite the interesting person, just saying :)
Jul 03 15:47:19 <Gaynigger>	Ah
Jul 03 15:47:22 <Gaynigger>	wanna fuck for it?
Jul 03 15:47:45 <lf94>	I though Haskell wraps everything into 1 argument functions
Jul 03 15:48:05 <lf94>	How else would it pass values down to other functions
Jul 03 15:48:05 *	NeoTerra_ has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Jul 03 15:48:11 <Gaynigger>	No, internally into zero argument functions actually
Jul 03 15:48:18 <Gaynigger>	lf94, it's pushed on top of the pattern stack.
Jul 03 15:48:23 <lf94>	Ah.
Jul 03 15:48:28 <Gaynigger>	THe currently active function inspects that.
Jul 03 15:48:40 <lf94>	Yeah yeah yeah
Jul 03 15:48:49 <Gaynigger>	It has some elements of continuation passing style how GHC works internally.
Jul 03 15:48:59 <Gaynigger>	THe spineless tagless G machine as they call it
Jul 03 15:49:05 <lf94>	You are actually a fucking PhD genius under that username aren't you
Jul 03 15:49:28 <Gaynigger>	Absolutely not.
Jul 03 15:49:30 <Gaynigger>	I never finsihed my degree.
Jul 03 15:49:37 <lf94>	But you were on your way
Jul 03 15:50:03 <lf94>	Anyways, thanks for the information- it's seriously very interesting material
Jul 03 15:51:35 <lf94>	Gaynigger; I'm inspiration
Jul 03 15:51:40 <lf94>	An
Jul 03 15:51:43 <lf94>	Wow how did I even
Jul 03 15:51:47 <Gaynigger>	lf94, not really, grades were bad, bad relationship with fellow students, teachers disliked me and I disliked them.
Jul 03 15:52:03 <Gaynigger>	lf94, you should google 'spineless tagless g machine'there is a lot of literature about it because it's quite frankly brilliant
Jul 03 15:52:16 <Gaynigger>	IT's how GHC operates internally and does things completely differently than anything before it
Jul 03 15:52:30 <lf94>	I will definitely look around
Jul 03 15:52:37 <Gaynigger>	The novelness of it is that currying comes at no cost in this model.
Jul 03 15:52:43 <lf94>	Also you seem like a pretty fine person
Jul 03 15:53:12 <Gaynigger>	In Ocaml, ((f x) y), assuming the cmpiler doesn't rewrite, is actually slower than (f x y),  in GHC it doesn't matter.

Jul 03 15:57:31 <lf94>	Yeah that's what I've been using
Jul 03 15:57:44 <Gaynigger>	Haskell still gives me a headache, its syntax is mentally retarded in my opinion.
Jul 03 15:57:49 <lf94>	I recently got Real Word Haskell too, as recommended by the guys in ##programming on freenode
Jul 03 15:58:02 <Gaynigger>	It's frustrating as fuck to work with all that ridiculous amount of syntactic sugar because it leads to bonkers error messages.
Jul 03 15:58:21 <Gaynigger>	You should ask them about me on #haskell on freenode, they will probably refer to me as a retard
Jul 03 15:58:26 <Gaynigger>	I am not on friendly term with those people.
Jul 03 15:58:44 <lf94>	Really? I find the syntax to be pretty elegant...I haven't run into any syntactic sugar yet, beside the implicit "all functions boil down to 1 argument functions" thing

Jul 03 15:59:39 <Gaynigger>	Well, 1 year back.
Jul 03 16:00:01 <Gaynigger>	I was trying to define (..) f g x y = (f (g x y))
Jul 03 16:00:08 <Gaynigger>	THat got the most cryptic error
Jul 03 16:00:16 <Gaynigger>	you know why I can't use an operator (..)?
Jul 03 16:00:21 <Gaynigger>	Because of [n..m] notation
Jul 03 16:00:26 <Gaynigger>	Which is completely fucking useless.
Jul 03 16:00:31 <Gaynigger>	range n m suffices
Jul 03 16:00:40 <lf94>	<_>
Jul 03 16:00:41 <Gaynigger>	Haskell is filled with such bullshit
Jul 03 16:00:46 <lf94>	Ok that is painful
Jul 03 16:01:07 <lf94>	Ok that really turns me off to Haskell
Jul 03 16:01:09 <Gaynigger>	Or ehh [Int] as syntax for a type.
Jul 03 16:01:14 <Gaynigger>	List Int suffices
Jul 03 16:01:18 <lf94>	?!
Jul 03 16:01:23 <Gaynigger>	Why do lists as the ONE type constructor need special syntax
Jul 03 16:01:29 <lf94>	And here I was thinking Haskell was consistent
Jul 03 16:01:35 <Gaynigger>	Internally it is very much
Jul 03 16:01:41 <Gaynigger>	but the syntax is just, I don't know.
Jul 03 16:01:50 <lf94>	That's why I *love* Python 3
Jul 03 16:01:52 <Gaynigger>	It just leads to weird error messages often
Jul 03 16:01:54 <lf94>	So much consistency
Jul 03 16:01:59 <Gaynigger>	Python also has weird stuff though
Jul 03 16:02:03 <Gaynigger>	like x < y < z in python
Jul 03 16:02:09 <ufuki>	plus it's slow as shit
Jul 03 16:02:15 <Gaynigger>	Is neither (x < y) < z nor x < (y < z)
Jul 03 16:02:19 <lf94>	ufuki: Python is not about speed
Jul 03 16:02:29 <Gaynigger>	"Frankly, I could never understand why everyone liked Python. It's slow and a crap language. C++ is crap, but super fast." - /u/silverlake
Jul 03 16:02:41 <Gaynigger>	But yeah, python doesn't try to be fast
Jul 03 16:02:48 <lf94>	Gaynigger: clearly a special case
Jul 03 16:02:51 <lf94>	with x < y < z
Jul 03 16:02:54 <Gaynigger>	Yeah
Jul 03 16:02:56 <ufuki>	I don't know why people would use it then
Jul 03 16:03:00 <lf94>	What about 4
Jul 03 16:03:04 <ufuki>	inb4 "muh prototyping"
Jul 03 16:03:05 <lf94>	w < x < y < z
Jul 03 16:03:11 <lf94>	ufuki: that's exactly it
Jul 03 16:03:19 <lf94>	prototyping is so fast
Jul 03 16:03:30 <lf94>	If I want speed I'll go the C route
Jul 03 16:03:32 <Gaynigger>	One assumes that is the same as w < x and x < y and y < z
Jul 03 16:03:47 <lf94>	Ok that is fucked up :)
Jul 03 16:04:11 <Gaynigger>	ufuki, because it's very rare that readability and maintainability of code need to be sacrificed for speed?
Jul 03 16:04:18 <lf94>	Just never tell people about x < y < z and everything will be good
Jul 03 16:04:23 <Gaynigger>	THere is very little software running today where speed is a problem.
Jul 03 16:04:48 <Gaynigger>	No one is going to care if you log in to a site in 1 microsecond longer, what people care about is bugs.
Jul 03 16:04:48 <ufuki>	true, it's more of an OCD thing with me
Jul 03 16:05:01 <Gaynigger>	And as it stands, langauges that are super fast like C and C++ sacrifice type safety to get there.
Jul 03 16:05:13 <Gaynigger>	Programs written in HAskell cannot segfault, that helps.
Jul 03 16:05:15 <lf94>	ufuki: you will come full circle one day
Jul 03 16:05:20 <Gaynigger>	Unless you open up System.IO.Unsafe
Jul 03 16:05:54 <lf94>	use slow, resource consuming applications that actually work -> become obsessed with speed and using terminal applications -> realize it's all just a fucking fad and get back to real life

Jul 03 16:06:47 <lf94>	*click*
Jul 03 16:06:54 <lf94>	1.1 Syntactic heroin
Jul 03 16:07:00 <lf94>	Oh boy
Jul 03 16:07:04 <Gaynigger>	Well, I had a program I rewrote to Haskell from python and it ran a loooot more quickly that I noticed it.
Jul 03 16:07:11 *	ufuki has quit (Quit: http://www.kiwiirc.com/ - A hand crafted IRC client)
Jul 03 16:07:21 <lf94>	Haskell is apparently right behind C and C++ in terms of speed
Jul 03 16:07:41 <Gaynigger>	But then again, I can recall at moment at $python on freenode where some C user was complaining about python's speed, and someone re-wrote that peron's C code in python and it ran faster because of a beter algorithm used.
Jul 03 16:07:48 <Gaynigger>	Yap.
Jul 03 16:07:54 <Gaynigger>	Haskell is one of the fastest languages on the planet.
Jul 03 16:08:19 <Gaynigger>	But the problem with those benchmark sites is that the code that is checked on them is often so heavily micro-optimized that it becomes unusable in practice to code like that
Jul 03 16:08:26 <Gaynigger>	nor would you want to because it removes all benefits from using said language.
Jul 03 16:08:37 <Gaynigger>	"Natural written" Haskell actually tends to outperform natural written C
Jul 03 16:08:57 <Gaynigger>	C can just get a loooot of stuff out of it by miticulous micro optimization, but at that point you might as well write in Assembly.
Jul 03 16:09:00 <lf94>	Was your resulting Haskell code longer than your Python
Jul 03 16:09:31 <lf94>	And did it feel more elegant writing Haskell compared to the Python code
Jul 03 16:09:48 <Gaynigger>	Haskell will always be shorter than python.
Jul 03 16:10:05 <Gaynigger>	Itw as considerably shorter, but it didn't feel elegant at all because it was something interfacing with xlib.
Jul 03 16:10:13 <Gaynigger>	FFI, which basically leads to very un-haskell like code.
Jul 03 16:10:27 <lf94>	Yeah I wouldn't be surprised by that
Jul 03 16:10:39 <lf94>	but I am surprised by the considerably shorter code
Jul 03 16:10:56 <lf94>	As I read through learnyouahaskell I feel like the code would be longer
Jul 03 16:11:59 <lf94>	Gaynigger: like I was saying earlier, any cool projects?

Jul 03 16:21:52 <lf94>	Huh, neat

Jul 03 16:24:10 <Gaynigger>	Nope

Jul 03 16:24:35 <Gaynigger>	C's type system int heory should also make that impossible, printf in C is not type safe basically

Jul 03 19:51:23 <threepoint14>	shix: no, ssd is an option you change in your fstab
Jul 03 19:51:28 <shix>	threepoint14: you need to buy an SSD
Jul 03 19:51:52 <bwmc>	threepoint14: did  you remove your /home /boot / and swap entries in /etc/fstab too?
Jul 03 19:51:54 <bwmc>	:|
Jul 03 19:52:02 <threepoint14>	you just have to edit the /etc/fstab to have it turn into ssd
Jul 03 19:52:14 <springworm>	threepoint14: do you actually own an ssd?
Jul 03 19:52:16 <threepoint14>	bwmc: at the moment yeah.  so i'm on here, trying to make sense of
Jul 03 19:52:24 <threepoint14>	file system, mopiunt point, type, options, dump and pass
Jul 03 19:52:25 <springworm>	you can't magically turn your mechanical drive into an ssd
Jul 03 19:52:48 <threepoint14>	springworm: no.  i have a HD which i'm trying to convert to ssd
Jul 03 19:52:54 <threepoint14>	it's an fstab command
Jul 03 19:53:07 <ElTimablo>	.....ow.

Jul 03 20:16:51 <jmbi>	after using 2bwm for so long, any DE makes me feel uncomfortable because I feel like it's bloated
Jul 03 20:16:51 <P3>	My beef with the dash is that it doesn't function like a regular launcher and there isn't a way to get it like that.
Jul 03 20:16:55 <shix>	i havent used a DE in years
Jul 03 20:17:29 <ElTimablo>	P3: My beef with it is that you can't theme it without changing a billion tiny pixmaps.
Jul 03 20:18:00 <P3>	That's a good point too. Never been that much into themeing.
Jul 03 20:18:58 <ElTimablo>	I wouldn't care, but it looks SO BAD.

Jul 03 22:15:41 <P3>	By /exit

Jul 03 22:15:55 <Foggalong>	P3 ~/.config/thing is the standard iirc

Jul 03 22:16:14 <P3>	To be honest, that would make more sense.
Jul 03 22:16:18 <MrSnowShow>	Yay
Jul 03 22:16:30 <P3>	And MrSnowShow, I think you can /exit REASON to exit with a reason...I think.
Jul 03 22:17:17 <MrSnowShow>	Oh okay
Jul 03 22:17:17 <unrulypainter>	hmm? isn't it /quit? or are they aliases?
Jul 03 22:17:46 <P3>	Yeah, it's /quit.
Jul 03 22:17:58 <napalm>	weechat uses /exit
Jul 03 22:18:04 <P3>	The default config has /bye, /exit, and /signoff as aliases for /quit.
Jul 03 22:18:28 <P3>	Is there anything like BBSes nowadays? Where we can log in to some forum via terminal?
Jul 03 22:18:38 <P3>	...That isn't logging into a forum via elinks/lynx?
Jul 03 22:22:36 <springworm>	i kinda doubt it

Jul 03 22:38:56 <P3>	Holy crap I need better terminal colors. Makes it almost impossible to read comments or numbers in htop.
Jul 03 22:39:32 <MrSnowShow>	Where do you configure terminal colors? (last question haha)
Jul 03 22:39:51 <P3>	~/.Xresources
Jul 03 22:40:30 <P3>	This may also depend on what terminal you use.
Jul 03 22:40:43 <MrSnowShow>	I think I'm using the i3's terminal
Jul 03 22:40:53 <MrSnowShow>	xresourses means I need to use Xterm right?
Jul 03 22:41:01 <P3>	No, it's not limited to Xterm.
Jul 03 22:41:05 <napalm>	i3 doesn't have a terminal, It uses your standard terminal
Jul 03 22:41:09 <P3>	I'm using urxvt.

Jul 03 22:50:31 <P3>	Mostly named after the ye olde Strong Bad Emails.
Jul 03 22:50:55 <Foggalong>	Cool!

Jul 04 06:50:15 <Foggalong>	Morning folks
Jul 04 06:50:37 <MysteryForumGuy>	Morning.
Jul 04 06:50:47 <MysteryForumGuy>	shix, is there a command to see who's online? That would work instead.
Jul 04 06:50:57 <shix>	well you could do /names
Jul 04 06:51:16 <shix>	but im pretty sure theres a way to fix the name seeing thing
Jul 04 06:51:18 <MysteryForumGuy>	Ah. That works. I guess that's good enough unless I can figure out how to make it show when people join/leave.
Jul 04 06:51:30 <shix>	MysteryForumGuy: can you show me his config?
Jul 04 06:51:36 <MysteryForumGuy>	Let me find the link.

Jul 04 06:52:05 <MysteryForumGuy>	Used part of the config file and the whole theme file

Jul 04 06:54:27 <shix>	the whole ignores = (
Jul 04 06:54:46 <shix>	basically the last 4 lines lol
Jul 04 06:55:04 <MysteryForumGuy>	Oh shit, I was looking in the theme file for it.
Jul 04 06:55:10 <MysteryForumGuy>	Probably would help if I was actually in the config.
Jul 04 06:55:19 <MysteryForumGuy>	sudo gedit config

Jul 04 06:55:23 <MysteryForumGuy>	fuck me
Jul 04 06:55:33 <shix>	why are you using sudo to edit the config lol
Jul 04 06:56:11 <MysteryForumGuy>	It's in a hidden folder. I don't know if it will let me save or not if I don't use sudo.
Jul 04 06:56:24 <MysteryForumGuy>	I feel the judgement of my ignorance.
Jul 04 06:57:19 <shix>	shouldnt need sudo to edit it even if its in a hidden folder

Jul 04 12:11:19 <gaynigger>	THat
Jul 04 12:11:24 <gaynigger>	's highly subjective.
Jul 04 12:11:43 <gaynigger>	People who make such rules typically are so narrowminded they don't realize that everyone has a different conception thereof.
Jul 04 12:14:49 <napalm>	Yeah sure the person who is feeling offended should just say he is offended. 
Jul 04 12:15:12 <napalm>	and then the offending person should just stop
Jul 04 12:15:15 <napalm>	nothing more
Jul 04 12:15:33 <gaynigger>	napalm, what if there are two people who are offended by the opposite.
Jul 04 12:15:40 <gaynigger>	One person offended by the word 'nigger', the other by 'the n-word'
Jul 04 12:15:45 <gaynigger>	What are you going to do then?
Jul 04 12:15:52 <gaynigger>	Someone has to then step in and decide whose being offended is worth more.
Jul 04 12:16:18 <napalm>	Then just don't say both anymore and move on
Jul 04 12:17:59 <gaynigger>	And what if a third person is offended by someone not addressing the issue about it?
Jul 04 12:18:20 <gaynigger>	What if someone is offended by not apologizing for something, and anotherperson is offended by apologizing for it.
Jul 04 12:21:18 <napalm>	Ok, just solve it in a way they all agree and move on
Jul 04 12:21:29 <gaynigger>	napalm, clearly the scenario above excludes that.
Jul 04 12:21:33 <gaynigger>	One person is always going to be offended.
Jul 04 12:21:40 <gaynigger>	And such situations are in fact fairly common.
Jul 04 12:21:56 <gaynigger>	Someone has to step in and arbitrary decide whose concerns are more valid, which tends to come down to 'With whom do I personally agree more?'
Jul 04 12:25:25 <napalm>	hmm ok
Jul 04 12:25:39 <napalm>	But I don't see how law offers al solution to that
Jul 04 12:25:53 <napalm>	It's just excluding certain people
Jul 04 12:26:02 <napalm>	or concerns
Jul 04 12:27:14 <napalm>	And every situation is always a bit different
Jul 04 12:43:28 <gaynigger>	napalm, it codifies which ones are excluded instead of making it up at a whim.
Jul 04 12:43:33 <gaynigger>	Becuase in the latter case it can be abused.

Jul 04 14:20:46 <mbls>	thatd have to be one hot GILF
Jul 04 14:21:26 <bwmc>	being attracted to cougars is a thing that happens to autistic virgins after years of rejection
Jul 04 14:21:37 <bwmc>	they finally realize that their only chance of sex is a pity from from a bored lonely cougar

Jul 04 16:39:02 <MrSnowShow>	.Xresources doens't have any values there

Jul 04 16:41:29 <MrSnowShow>	I think

Jul 04 17:24:05 <P3>	Hoy.
Jul 04 17:24:31 <owen>	So linux
Jul 04 17:24:35 <owen>	Pretty great huh
Jul 04 17:25:14 *	P3 has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)
Jul 04 17:25:16 <MrSnowShow>	Yep
Jul 04 17:25:31 <MrSnowShow>	What are you running?
Jul 04 17:25:38 <owen>	Manjaro
Jul 04 17:25:50 <owen>	Still fairly new to all this, just now getting comfortable
Jul 04 17:26:11 <owen>	Finally got vim and i3 all set up
Jul 04 17:26:20 <owen>	Though still not too happy with my i3bar setup
Jul 04 17:26:23 <MrSnowShow>	Also got i3 yesterday
Jul 04 17:26:58 <MrSnowShow>	But my version is 4.2 for some reason (not the latest) and some codes do not work
Jul 04 17:27:10 <owen>	Is it just me or do windows by default take up your whole screen when you launch them?
Jul 04 17:27:17 <MrSnowShow>	Of course
Jul 04 17:27:22 <MrSnowShow>	that is the point of i3
Jul 04 17:27:37 <owen>	Ah okay, so all those screenshots of people with their windows but also having a wallpaper showing
Jul 04 17:27:43 <owen>	they had to specifically set that up?
Jul 04 17:28:02 <MrSnowShow>	you can use $mod+shift+space to make them float
Jul 04 17:28:16 <owen>	already learning!
Jul 04 17:28:22 <owen>	That's pretty cool
Jul 04 17:28:53 <owen>	Though I'm running this on an old dell laptop so screen real-estate is already a bit of a premium
Jul 04 17:29:06 <MrSnowShow>	Also do not forget to use workspaces
Jul 04 17:29:15 <MrSnowShow>	I have browser fullscreen on 1
Jul 04 17:29:26 <MrSnowShow>	IRC, htop and screenfetch at 2
Jul 04 17:29:30 <owen>	Yeah, really liking those
Jul 04 17:29:34 <MrSnowShow>	3 for SKype
Jul 04 17:29:50 <owen>	]One thing I wish you could do is set a permanent order to them
Jul 04 17:29:55 <owen>	without having to have numbers in the name
Jul 04 17:30:07 *	napalm has quit (Quit: WeeChat 0.4.2)
Jul 04 17:30:24 <MrSnowShow>	No idea
Jul 04 17:30:28 <MrSnowShow>	I'm also learning
Jul 04 17:30:30 <owen>	I renamed mine to use chinese numbers because I like the look of that better
Jul 04 17:30:37 <owen>	but if I use them out of order
Jul 04 17:30:53 <owen>	like put my ssh tunnel window on 9 because I don't need to see it
Jul 04 17:30:59 <owen>	suddenly 9 is before 2 or whatever

Jul 04 17:31:54 <owen>	I'll  just have to get used to making sure I open them in the right order
Jul 04 17:33:01 <owen>	Is there a specific place to find themes and colorschemes for xterm or vim or anything?
Jul 04 17:33:18 <bwmc>	http://dotshare.it/
Jul 04 17:33:20 <pico>	Title: DotShare.it (at dotshare.it)
Jul 04 17:33:34 <bwmc>	I would highly suggest using rxvt-unicode-256color over xterm though
Jul 04 17:33:46 <owen>	Oh really?
Jul 04 17:33:49 <owen>	How come?
Jul 04 17:34:05 <bwmc>	just personal preference really, urxvt has some nicer features
Jul 04 17:34:14 <bwmc>	better perl integration, tabs, daemon mode
Jul 04 17:34:27 <bwmc>	xterm is old and bloated, its just legacy code
Jul 04 17:34:36 <owen>	Interesting, wasn't aware of that
Jul 04 17:34:38 <owen>	I'll check it out
Jul 04 17:34:55 <owen>	Are the colour settings the same?
Jul 04 17:34:58 <bwmc>	yeah
Jul 04 17:35:19 <owen>	so I just rename *xterm to *rxvt or whatever?
Jul 04 17:36:06 <bwmc>	URxvt*colorX: <color>
Jul 04 17:36:16 <bwmc>	in your Xresources, but yeah its pretty damn straight forward

Jul 04 17:37:33 <MrSnowShow>	So to change color scheme of any terminal I need to put it in .Xresources?
Jul 04 17:38:06 <bwmc>	only terminals that use X resources (urxvt, xterm etc)
Jul 04 17:38:38 <owen>	Alright, downloaded it
Jul 04 17:38:43 <MrSnowShow>	Terminator Terminal uses it too right?
Jul 04 17:38:51 <owen>	My PS1 stuff isn't coloured though
Jul 04 17:39:14 <springworm>	terminator doesn't use Xresources
Jul 04 17:39:21 <MrSnowShow>	fuck
Jul 04 17:39:36 <MrSnowShow>	new terminal then
Jul 04 17:39:49 <springworm>	hold up
Jul 04 17:39:53 <MrSnowShow>	owen, here's a nice tool to set up the PS1 https://www.kirsle.net/wizards/ps1.html
Jul 04 17:39:55 <pico>	Title: Bash $PS1 Generator 2.0 (at www.kirsle.net)
Jul 04 17:40:05 <springworm>	if open up .config/terminator/config
Jul 04 17:40:11 <springworm>	you can input raw hex values
Jul 04 17:40:26 <MrSnowShow>	let me try that
Jul 04 17:40:27 <owen>	That's what I used
Jul 04 17:40:36 <owen>	My Xterm's PS1 thing has colours
Jul 04 17:40:42 <owen>	but URxvt doesn't
Jul 04 17:42:43 <springworm>	my PS1 is a mess
Jul 04 17:42:56 <springworm>	because i use the set_prompt() function to set it
Jul 04 17:43:43 <owen>	Can you set multiple fonts in urxvt?

Jul 04 18:10:28 <bwmc>	the only thing bad about i3 is the resize hints problem
Jul 04 18:10:36 <bwmc>	because it refuses to put gaps between terms
Jul 04 18:10:47 <MrSnowShow>	but I somehow managed to resize a window
Jul 04 18:10:47 <bwmc>	so sometimes you are left with 2-3cm blank gaps
Jul 04 18:10:58 <bwmc>	$mod + mouse
Jul 04 18:11:04 <bwmc>	left click
Jul 04 18:11:07 <bwmc>	and drag
Jul 04 18:11:16 <Rabbit>	Well by default mine have no gaps
Jul 04 18:11:32 <Rabbit>	First window is full screen then splits it up from there
Jul 04 18:11:38 <Rabbit>	Is that normal?
Jul 04 18:11:43 <MrSnowShow>	ofcourse

Jul 04 18:27:44 <Rabbit_>	Anyone of experience changing the font of URxvt?
Jul 04 18:27:56 <Rabbit_>	I put this in my .Xresources file:

Jul 04 18:28:15 <MrSnowShow>	haha no copy paste?
Jul 04 18:28:20 <Rabbit_>	yeah lol

Jul 04 18:28:25 <Rabbit_>	just as ec
Jul 04 18:29:00 <Rabbit_>	
Jul 04 18:29:05 <Rabbit_>	Okay I dunno how to paste in here

Jul 04 18:29:53 <Rabbit_>	anyone who knows URxvt
Jul 04 18:34:42 <springworm>	MrSnowShow: it copies on selection and pastes with middle mouse click
Jul 04 18:35:12 <springworm>	Rabbit_: what happens if you type in
Jul 04 18:35:31 <springworm>	urxvt -fn 'xft:WenQuanYi Zen Hei Mono'
Jul 04 18:36:14 <Rabbit_>	huh, that works
Jul 04 18:36:16 <springworm>	did you remember to run xrdb ~/.Xresources after you added the line?
Jul 04 18:36:20 <Rabbit_>	yeah
Jul 04 18:36:31 <Rabbit_>	even killed X once
Jul 04 18:36:45 <springworm>	i'd guess the formatting of your Xresources is wonky then
Jul 04 18:37:03 <springworm>	maybe add spaces?
Jul 04 18:37:11 <springworm>	and quotation marks

Jul 04 18:41:29 <Rabbit_>	no error, just uses the default font

Jul 04 18:43:32 <Rabbit_>	There you cna see the difference
Jul 04 18:43:41 <Rabbit_>	the top light grey is using -fn to load it
Jul 04 18:43:52 <Rabbit_>	bottom light grey is just urxvt
Jul 04 18:44:02 <springworm>	shix: that was MrSnowShow 
Jul 04 18:44:43 <springworm>	Rabbit_: i'm gonna install this font and see if i can get it to work
Jul 04 18:45:05 <Rabbit_>	I mean the font works
Jul 04 18:45:09 <Rabbit_>	since using -fn works
Jul 04 18:45:18 <Rabbit_>	it's just not loading it out of the Xresources for some reason
Jul 04 18:45:26 <springworm>	yeah i mean testing the Xresources
Jul 04 18:45:41 <Rabbit_>	I can try a different font
Jul 04 18:45:44 <springworm>	wqy-microhei-lite package?
Jul 04 18:45:51 <Rabbit_>	uh
Jul 04 18:45:54 <Rabbit_>	potentially
Jul 04 18:46:10 <Rabbit_>	I also have a font like WenQuanYi Micro Hei
Jul 04 18:46:21 <Rabbit_>	What font do you use?
Jul 04 18:46:22 <Rabbit_>	I can try that
Jul 04 18:46:25 <Rabbit_>	and see if it works
Jul 04 18:47:02 <shix>	springworm: MrSnowShow: seems like easiest way i got it working was using xbindkeys

Jul 04 18:55:41 <springworm>	so do you have a keybinding for urxvt?
Jul 04 18:55:52 <Rabbit>	yeah, mod+enter
Jul 04 18:56:24 <springworm>	and it works? even though it can't find the font?
Jul 04 18:56:29 <Rabbit>	yup
Jul 04 18:56:32 <Rabbit>	just looks ugly
Jul 04 18:56:56 <Rabbit>	the weird thing is setting it was -fn totally worked
Jul 04 18:57:07 <Rabbit>	so it's just not reading the Xresources file right
Jul 04 18:57:15 <springworm>	that's really weird, because when i have a nonexistent font, trying to run urxvt just prints unable to load base fontset and exits
Jul 04 18:58:19 <Rabbit>	That suggests that it's not even reading Xresources
Jul 04 18:59:11 <springworm>	are you sure you're writing to the correct file
Jul 04 18:59:33 <Rabbit>	It's the same file that's worked for xterm
Jul 04 19:00:36 <springworm>	and you're certain your mod+enter is specifically running urxvt, not i3-term or xterm or something?
Jul 04 19:00:53 <Rabbit>	Yes, but I've also been typing urxvt into xterm
Jul 04 19:00:55 <Rabbit>	to launch it
Jul 04 19:01:16 <springworm>	right
Jul 04 19:01:59 <bwmc>	terminus doesnt require the xset fp /usr/share/fonts/local
Jul 04 19:02:05 <bwmc>	its no longer installed there since a few versions back
Jul 04 19:02:34 <springworm>	awesome
Jul 04 19:03:21 <bwmc>	Rabbit: are you doing URxvt*font: -*-terminus-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
Jul 04 19:03:40 <bwmc>	in Xresources, then in your .xinitrc xrdb ~/.Xresources
Jul 04 19:04:25 <Rabbit>	yeah

Jul 04 19:14:10 <springworm>	why doesn't your urxvt pay attention to anything in xresources
Jul 04 19:14:29 <Rabbit>	could there be a permissions issue?
Jul 04 19:14:33 <bwmc>	no
Jul 04 19:14:43 <Rabbit>	what about xterm running at the same time?

Jul 05 20:29:04 <P3>	And if you use DuckDuckGo, you can throw in the !arch bang to go there. eg. "xterm !arch"
Jul 05 20:34:26 <lf94>	P3: default xterm font is actually fine
Jul 05 21:15:16 <MrSnowShow>	I'm using Crunchbang
Jul 05 21:16:33 <P3>	That was me being curious, MrSnowShow. Just remember the Arch wiki can be mighty helpful.
Jul 05 21:18:15 <MrSnowShow>	Yes arch wiki is amazing
Jul 05 21:18:40 <MrSnowShow>	Are there similar distros to Arch where you start with nothing and just build your system from there?
Jul 05 21:19:32 <mbls>	debian net install is sorta like that
Jul 05 21:19:52 <P3>	Think Gentoo sort of is as well or I read wrong about it.
Jul 05 21:20:03 <P3>	Except with Gentoo, you have to compile _everything_.
Jul 05 21:22:10 <MrSnowShow>	Wait, debian comes with nothing too like Arch? Or there is a special install with nothing?
Jul 05 21:24:23 <mbls>	yeah the net install is pretty barebones

Jul 05 21:29:23 <MrSnowShow>	That's awesome
Jul 05 21:30:00 <MrSnowShow>	because most distros come with WMs DEs and bunch of GUI programs and stuff
Jul 05 21:30:12 <MrSnowShow>	And when you're trying to make a hacker-like comp
Jul 05 21:30:18 <MrSnowShow>	it gets in the way
Jul 05 21:41:48 <springworm>	i ran a more "hacker-like" setup on linux mint with i3, it's not that difficult
Jul 05 21:45:17 <P3>	I never thought I'd get used to i3. But I did.
Jul 05 21:49:51 <MrSnowShow>	i3 is sexy as fuck
Jul 05 21:50:00 <MrSnowShow>	btw, how do you guys ajust the volume?
Jul 05 21:53:29 <springworm>	amixer -1 set Master 3dB+
Jul 05 21:53:30 <springworm>	or
Jul 05 21:53:32 <springworm>	amixer -1 set Master 3dB-
Jul 05 21:53:47 <springworm>	shit the -1 is supposed to be -q, can't type
Jul 05 21:54:01 <springworm>	i have those in a script bound to the media keys
Jul 05 21:59:57 <P3>	I always use the volume dial on my headphones. Good enough for most things. Otherwise I just open up ALSAmixer in a terminal and change system volume there.
Jul 05 22:03:25 <springworm>	every time i suspend my system and wake it up, the screen goes into crazy fucking purple/green flickering mode

Jul 05 23:37:52 <MysteryForumGuy>	So, uh, I ran updates on my system and then rebooted and now the mouse and the Internet don't work.
Jul 05 23:40:32 <MysteryForumGuy>	Help? I'm on ubuntu, used the automatic system updater program.
Jul 05 23:40:37 <MysteryForumGuy>	What in the world could have happened.
Jul 05 23:42:55 <springworm>	if you run xinput, does it still list the mouse
Jul 05 23:43:33 <MysteryForumGuy>	Lists a "Virtual core pointer"
Jul 05 23:43:37 <MysteryForumGuy>	is that a mouse.
Jul 05 23:44:27 <springworm>	should be
Jul 05 23:45:20 <springworm>	look at the item under virtual core pointer that's not XTEST thing
Jul 05 23:45:27 <springworm>	get its id #
Jul 05 23:45:37 <springworm>	do xinput test [the id number]
Jul 05 23:45:47 <springworm>	and try moving the mouse around/clicking things
Jul 05 23:47:51 <MysteryForumGuy>	Only the XTEST thing is under the virtual core pointer
Jul 05 23:47:57 <MysteryForumGuy>	And I tried to test that and it is doing nothing

Jul 05 23:56:31 <MysteryForumGuy>	When I plug in a mouse it works.
Jul 05 23:56:42 <MysteryForumGuy>	The track pad, and for some reason the Internet, doesn't work.
Jul 05 23:57:58 <MysteryForumGuy>	"An error has occured, please run Package Manager from the right-click menu or apt-get in terminal to see what is wrong. The error message was: 'ErrorLBrokenCount > 0'. This usually means that your installed packages have unmet dependencies"
Jul 05 23:58:02 <MysteryForumGuy>	That is what the computer tells me.

Jul 05 23:59:37 <lf94>	1) Get a shorter username
Jul 05 23:59:45 <MysteryForumGuy>	Will do that after my computer is fixed
Jul 06 00:00:00 <lf94>	2) Install synaptic
Jul 06 00:00:12 <MysteryForumGuy>	If it broke the Internet how in the world do I install synaptic.
Jul 06 00:00:25 <lf94>	Define "broke the Internet"
Jul 06 00:00:32 <lf94>	Do I need to call the President?
Jul 06 00:00:53 <MysteryForumGuy>	Yes.
Jul 06 00:01:01 <MysteryForumGuy>	The Internet won't work.

Jul 06 00:01:21 <lf94>	1) Is your wireless device working
Jul 06 00:01:27 <lf94>	Ok, so no
Jul 06 00:01:34 <lf94>	lspci

Jul 06 00:02:13 <MysteryForumGuy>	Network Controller: Qualcomm Atheros AR9485 Wireless Network Adapter (rev 01)
Jul 06 00:02:15 <MysteryForumGuy>	So it is there.
Jul 06 00:02:18 <MysteryForumGuy>	That's good to know.
Jul 06 00:02:42 <lf94>	No it was always there
Jul 06 00:02:42 <MysteryForumGuy>	I get that.
Jul 06 00:02:43 <MysteryForumGuy>	There but not working.
Jul 06 00:02:45 <MysteryForumGuy>	Why.
Jul 06 00:02:54 <lf94>	I have to leave
Jul 06 00:02:57 <MysteryForumGuy>	Darn.
Jul 06 00:03:01 <lf94>	Someone else can definitely help you though
Jul 06 00:03:06 <lf94>	Atheros are *well* supported
Jul 06 00:03:31 <MysteryForumGuy>	something broke when updating though. So I'll google the error the package manager spit out.

Jul 08 23:05:53 <Joom>	I've done worse
Jul 08 23:06:00 <Joom>	pipelight takes about three hours
Jul 08 23:06:20 <rdlrn>	bleh

Jul 08 23:06:53 <rdlrn>	funtoo :)
Jul 08 23:06:59 <rdlrn>	sounded more fun
Jul 08 23:07:08 <bwmc>	enjoy your no support, extremely limited wiki
Jul 08 23:07:19 <bwmc>	and the fact that gentoo information isnt applicable to funtoo
Jul 08 23:07:37 <bwmc>	so you're gonna be running it blind
Jul 08 23:07:39 <bwmc>	as far as the future goes
Jul 08 23:07:43 <bwmc>	:)
Jul 08 23:07:59 <rdlrn>	well considering I just started I can allways change if I can't figure it out
Jul 08 23:08:17 <Joom>	I've never used anything gentoo
Jul 08 23:08:32 <rdlrn>	until today I hadn't either
Jul 08 23:09:22 <rdlrn>	I did have a stint of freebsd,  but that was shortlived.  I had to use the current branch (like arch unstable) just to get kms to work properly
Jul 08 23:09:29 <rdlrn>	im sure freebsd is cool on a desktop
Jul 08 23:09:43 <rdlrn>	but with integrated nvidia/intel cards it's a pita

Jul 08 23:11:03 <rdlrn>	lol
Jul 08 23:11:17 <rdlrn>	it has it's place
Jul 08 23:11:45 <bwmc>	freebsd is pretty horrific in general, it doesn't even serve a purpose
Jul 08 23:11:57 <bwmc>	its performance oriented, yet the performance is shit
Jul 08 23:12:02 <bwmc>	especially compared to gnu/linux
Jul 08 23:12:19 <bwmc>	definately does not belong on the desktop
Jul 08 23:12:25 <rdlrn>	I seem to have stepped into a den of sunshine
Jul 08 23:12:53 <Joom>	I really only find it useful for networking
Jul 08 23:13:01 <Joom>	and even then openbsd has it beat there
Jul 08 23:13:12 <rdlrn>	^
Jul 08 23:13:16 <bwmc>	but it can't even do that right though, freebsd tcp/ip implementation is decades behind gnu/linux
Jul 08 23:13:31 <Joom>	Yeah I know
Jul 08 23:13:56 <Joom>	I can never understand why it has such a huge fanbase
Jul 08 23:14:13 <bwmc>	because people who were poorly misinformed
Jul 08 23:14:13 <rdlrn>	the beastie logo
Jul 08 23:14:19 <bwmc>	that freebsd is a superior os
Jul 08 23:14:41 <ElTimablo>	What benefits does *BSD offer?
Jul 08 23:15:16 <bwmc>	bragging rights, if you're into that sort of thing...
Jul 08 23:15:25 <bwmc>	only real benefit that stands up on paper
Jul 08 23:15:37 <bwmc>	is that its mostly BSD licensed, so you can pretty much do what you want with it
Jul 08 23:15:50 <bwmc>	but the userland is largely GNU, even today
Jul 08 23:15:56 <bwmc>	so its somewhat redundant
Jul 08 23:16:08 <Joom>	ElTimablo, there's jails, which are better than a chroot environment imo
Jul 08 23:16:26 <Joom>	But that's really the only thing I can think of

Jul 11 18:11:07 <Foggalong>	What are people's thoughts on the [OS] tag?
Jul 11 18:11:27 <Foggalong>	(this isn't an official poll or anything, just curious)
Jul 11 18:17:40 <unrulypainter>	I'm not sure what you mean
Jul 11 18:18:49 <Foggalong>	Posts with the titles like "[Arch][XFCE] Perfect."
Jul 11 18:19:03 <Foggalong>	We've asked people to stop including the OS part of it

Jul 11 18:41:41 <unrulypainter>	Ah, yes, well, with the level of customization we tend to do, the underlying OS really doesn't matter that much anymore
Jul 11 18:41:50 <bwmc>	the wm/de part
Jul 11 18:41:53 <unrulypainter>	unless you're showing off your unity desktop I suppose
Jul 11 18:41:53 <bwmc>	is pointless
Jul 11 18:41:59 <unrulypainter>	but who does that anyway :P
Jul 11 18:43:45 <Foggalong>	Thanks folks
Jul 11 18:44:43 <unrulypainter>	I have an arch box and a mint box running the exact same desktop setup, and sometimes I forget which is which :|
Jul 11 18:48:48 <springworm>	why do you have two linux setups?
Jul 11 18:49:52 <unrulypainter>	oh I have more than 2
Jul 11 18:49:58 <unrulypainter>	those are just the desktops
Jul 11 18:50:10 <unrulypainter>	one at work, one at home
Jul 11 18:51:13 <springworm>	oh of course, i didn't realize they were seperate computers. haha
Jul 11 18:58:01 <unrulypainter>	ah, sorry for being unclear :)

Jul 11 20:15:05 <unrulypainter>	the average windows XP user does
Jul 11 20:17:18 <bwmc>	lf94: i did
Jul 11 20:17:21 <bwmc>	when i first into *nix
Jul 11 20:17:27 <bwmc>	root was my only user acc
Jul 11 20:17:30 <bwmc>	for a good 3-4 weeks
Jul 11 20:17:37 <unrulypainter>	how long ago was this?
Jul 11 20:17:42 <lf94>	I bet it felt pretty liberating
Jul 11 20:17:44 <bwmc>	4 years
Jul 11 20:17:51 <bwmc>	yeah it was pretty liberating
Jul 11 20:17:59 <unrulypainter>	I'm pretty sure my first linux install warned me against doing that
Jul 11 20:17:59 <bwmc>	the comfyness a low-privileged user acc provided
Jul 11 20:18:03 <unrulypainter>	in 1996
Jul 11 20:18:05 <unrulypainter>	so I didn't
Jul 11 20:18:29 <lf94>	plan 9 for life
Jul 11 20:18:30 <lf94>	no root users

Jul 11 20:52:49 <springworm>	having arch in a vm is pretty silly if you don't use it that often, the updates take forever
Jul 11 20:53:10 <unrulypainter>	heh true
Jul 11 20:53:20 <unrulypainter>	most of my vm's run debian I think
Jul 11 20:53:25 <unrulypainter>	lamp stack, testing stuff
Jul 11 20:53:56 <unrulypainter>	don't want to pollute my desktop with a bunch of web stacks
Jul 11 20:54:28 <oxez>	is there a way to view deleted posts? I saw a post with a nice wallpaper this week at work, but I can't find it anymore, this is a mystery
Jul 11 20:55:37 <unrulypainter>	what would be the point of deleting your post, if it can still be viewed after?

Jul 15 18:01:04 <quintessential_nigger>	specifically WM_ROLE
Jul 15 18:01:56 <Joom>	Depends on the WM. I only really know how with openbox.
Jul 15 18:03:30 <quintessential_nigger>	Joom, well, try me, since I used fluxbox
Jul 15 18:03:35 <quintessential_nigger>	Maybe it works there too
Jul 15 18:04:51 <Joom>	does fluxbox use an rc.xml?

Jul 15 18:07:20 <Joom>	Yeah, I wouldn't know
Jul 15 18:07:26 <Joom>	if ob, you do something like this

Jul 15 18:07:40 <Joom>	in*
Jul 15 18:09:03 <quintessential_nigger>	Joom, yeah, flux can also do that.
Jul 15 18:09:16 <quintessential_nigger>	But the issue is that I want one instance of firefox to not have those properties and another to do have it.
Jul 15 18:09:20 <quintessential_nigger>	And started with a different command.
Jul 15 18:09:43 <Joom>	set the command in your fbmenu then
Jul 15 18:09:52 <Joom>	make a new entry for it
Jul 15 18:10:47 <quintessential_nigger>	No, I mean I don't know how to implement the different command part.
Jul 15 18:10:59 <quintessential_nigger>	I want to be able to do something like fluxbox-start appname <window properties>
Jul 15 18:11:11 <Joom>	oh

Jul 15 18:19:44 <quintessential_nigger>	WM_ROLE
Jul 15 18:19:50 <quintessential_nigger>	So that fluxbox itself can hook onto it.
Jul 15 18:20:07 <quintessential_nigger>	I want to be able to start two types of terminals with each a different command, a normal one and an embedded terminal if you will

Jul 16 20:03:08 <ElTimablo>	Excellent. I won't be around much, but keep me in the loop.

Jul 16 22:04:18 <Barcelona>	Yeah
Jul 16 22:05:00 <adamstributer>	so I'm gonna pick some more brains if that's ok.
Jul 16 22:05:26 <shix>	zombie
Jul 16 22:05:27 <Barcelona>	Well I won't stop you
Jul 16 22:05:59 <Barcelona>	I got my finger caught in a roller today
Jul 16 22:06:18 <Barcelona>	It did not feel good
Jul 16 22:06:19 <adamstributer>	I'm using DWM, and trying to set all my xterm windows to be transparent (or somewhat at least). I've installed xcompmgr and trasset-df, and no matter what I do with those, I can't seem to get the windows transparent.
Jul 16 22:06:29 <Barcelona>	Ad
Jul 16 22:06:36 <adamstributer>	Definitely doesn't sound like it would feel good Barcelona
Jul 16 22:06:51 <Barcelona>	adamstributer: did you run xcompmger daemon first?
Jul 16 22:07:21 <adamstributer>	I didn't realize there was a daemon. I've got it starting up with my xinitrc per https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Per_Application_Transparency
Jul 16 22:07:23 <pico>	Title: Per Application Transparency - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
Jul 16 22:07:36 <Barcelona>	Oh
Jul 16 22:07:46 <Barcelona>	So did you restart X?
Jul 16 22:07:49 <Barcelona>	I mean
Jul 16 22:07:59 <Barcelona>	Since yiu added in to the xinit
Jul 16 22:08:13 <adamstributer>	I rebooted my machine, which should take care of that. I've also confirmed afterwards that xcompmgr is running after reboot.
Jul 16 22:08:22 <Barcelona>	Oh
Jul 16 22:08:26 <Barcelona>	Hang on
Jul 16 22:09:01 <Barcelona>	So...
Jul 16 22:09:16 <Barcelona>	You did try xterm & sleep .8s && transset-df -a, right...?
Jul 16 22:10:03 <adamstributer>	I believe I did at some point, yes.
Jul 16 22:10:15 <Barcelona>	Believe?
Jul 16 22:10:21 <adamstributer>	Haha yeah. Lemme try it again.
Jul 16 22:11:09 <Barcelona>	Also, when you get around to it, you ahould use compton rather than xcompmgr
Jul 16 22:11:21 <adamstributer>	Yeah, I did try that earlier. It worked then on the new window it created, but won't work now though.
Jul 16 22:11:26 <Barcelona>	It's less glitchy
Jul 16 22:11:46 <Barcelona>	Hmm
Jul 16 22:11:58 <Barcelona>	My suggestion?
Jul 16 22:12:06 <Barcelona>	Ditch xterm
Jul 16 22:12:10 <Barcelona>	Use urxvt
Jul 16 22:12:16 <Barcelona>	But
Jul 16 22:12:18 <adamstributer>	Haha right on. I'll probably try that soon.
Jul 16 22:12:22 <adamstributer>	I'm gonna try to switch to compton too
Jul 16 22:12:29 <Barcelona>	Tht wont solve your problem...
Jul 16 22:12:47 <Barcelona>	Unless xterm is the only thing that you want transparent
Jul 16 22:13:11 <adamstributer>	Yeah pretty much, though it would be nice to have options.
Jul 16 22:13:25 <Barcelona>	What login manager do you hse?
Jul 16 22:13:33 <Barcelona>	Use*
Jul 16 22:13:36 <adamstributer>	I tried to change xterm*transparent to true in .Xdefaults, but that didn't work either.
Jul 16 22:13:39 <adamstributer>	I don't actually. Not yet at least.
Jul 16 22:13:48 <Barcelona>	No, xterm doesnt do that
Jul 16 22:13:54 <Barcelona>	Urxvt does though
Jul 16 22:14:09 <adamstributer>	Right on, that's why that didn't work. I'll definitely have to check out urxvt
Jul 16 22:15:37 <Barcelona>	Urxvt is the god-tier terminal emulator
Jul 16 22:15:49 <adamstributer>	That's what I've gathered so far.
Jul 16 22:15:50 <shix>	^
Jul 16 22:16:02 <Barcelona>	It's what jesus would use if he came back
Jul 16 22:16:50 <adamstributer>	Hahaha

Jul 19 20:19:47 <anthony>	tbh i think osx is disgusting
Jul 19 20:19:58 <schmonit>	in what way?
Jul 19 20:20:10 <anthony>	its all plebiean and hipstery
Jul 19 20:20:13 <schmonit>	aesthetically?
Jul 19 20:20:14 <Joom>	I think it's a great system honestly.
Jul 19 20:20:16 <anthony>	and its proprietary
Jul 19 20:20:22 <anthony>	oh you dont have apple hardware
Jul 19 20:20:23 <Joom>	doesn't have to be
Jul 19 20:20:26 <anthony>	nty no support
Jul 19 20:20:45 <Joom>	the kernel is open source
Jul 19 20:20:54 <Joom>	as well as other parts
Jul 19 20:21:14 <schmonit>	It's Unix
Jul 19 20:21:22 <schmonit>	it's just very difficult to configure to how you want it to be
Jul 19 20:21:28 <Joom>	I like it for the fact that it's aesthetically pleasing and a UNIX like system with proprietary software support
Jul 19 20:21:53 <anthony>	UNIX is cool
Jul 19 20:22:00 <anthony>	i wish the bsds had more support
Jul 19 20:22:01 <schmonit>	and the fact that it doesn't have a built in package manager is quite poor
Jul 19 20:22:14 <Joom>	It's a bitch dumping your BIOS and building a custom DSDT just to get your video card working though
Jul 19 20:22:25 <anthony>	idk does bsd have one i think slack has one
Jul 19 20:22:33 <Joom>	bsd has ports
Jul 19 20:22:35 <Joom>	slack doesn't
Jul 19 20:22:39 <Joom>	well, it sort of does
Jul 19 20:22:44 <anthony>	i have no idea about anything other than pacman and plebitude
Jul 19 20:22:50 <Joom>	for third part stuff you need something like sbopkg
Jul 19 20:22:54 <anthony>	how do you get packages on either
Jul 19 20:22:59 <Joom>	otherwise you have to build slackbuilds
Jul 19 20:23:01 <anthony>	pkgutils i think i read
Jul 19 20:23:04 <anthony>	no idea how to use it
Jul 19 20:23:16 <Joom>	yeah, that's for managing the core software
Jul 19 20:23:46 <Joom>	party*
Jul 19 20:24:11 <Joom>	also, OS X is built on a lot of BSD code
Jul 19 20:24:14 <Joom>	and vice versa
Jul 19 20:24:42 <Joom>	also http://brew.sh/
Jul 19 20:24:43 <pico>	Title: Homebrew — The missing package manager for OS X (at brew.sh)
Jul 19 20:25:01 <Joom>	there's also macports but it's kinda outdated
Jul 19 20:25:10 <anthony>	yeah ive heard of homebrew before didnt know what it was
Jul 19 20:26:38 <Joom>	there's also http://www.hack-store.com/
Jul 19 20:26:39 <pico>	Title: HackStore (at www.hack-store.com)
Jul 19 20:27:43 <Joom>	and http://appbodega.com/

Jul 19 20:28:49 <Joom>	Ugh, I hate it when sunburns start to itch
Jul 19 20:28:56 <anthony>	what
Jul 19 20:29:01 <anthony>	you go outside
Jul 19 20:29:04 <anthony>	heathen
Jul 19 20:29:14 <Joom>	I just spent a weak at the beach
Jul 19 20:29:30 <anthony>	Wrong week there buddy :p
Jul 19 20:29:38 <Joom>	oh yeah
Jul 19 20:29:40 <Joom>	dorp
Jul 19 20:29:53 <Joom>	Sorry, I'm all scatter brain right now
Jul 19 20:30:10 <anthony>	there isnt a ~/.ncmpcpp
Jul 19 20:30:19 <anthony>	how am i supposed to get mpdviz working D:
Jul 19 20:32:07 <Joom>	make one?
Jul 19 20:32:12 <Joom>	or is it ~/.config?
Jul 19 20:32:16 <Joom>	in*
Jul 19 20:32:17 <anthony>	ugh
Jul 19 20:32:19 <anthony>	that takes work
Jul 19 20:32:24 <anthony>	ill go make it >.>
Jul 19 20:33:11 <schmonit>	I remember
Jul 19 20:33:22 <schmonit>	I think there's one that you can copy from somewhre in your fs
Jul 19 20:33:28 <schmonit>	an example config
Jul 19 20:33:37 <anthony>	i have to go find it then

Jul 19 21:21:20 <Joom>	I have not
Jul 19 21:21:42 <Joom>	looks neat
Jul 19 21:21:45 <t>	its a wonderful editor and its getting better
Jul 19 21:21:49 <springworm>	i tried it
Jul 19 21:21:53 <springworm>	it was annoying to install
Jul 19 21:22:02 <t>	its just fucking rediculous to get installed, yea
Jul 19 21:22:11 <Joom>	oh, it's only for os x
Jul 19 21:22:13 <springworm>	and since i'm not a webdev guy it wasn't too interesting
Jul 19 21:22:19 <springworm>	there's an AUR pacakge
Jul 19 21:22:22 <Joom>	oh
Jul 19 21:22:25 <t>	there's 3
Jul 19 21:22:48 <t>	atom-editor, atom-editor-git, and atom-editor-bin
Jul 19 21:23:20 <t>	...i can't get one to work across all my devices
Jul 19 21:33:15 <springworm>	someone looked at sublime text
Jul 19 21:33:21 <springworm>	and though "needs more node.js"
Jul 19 21:33:24 <springworm>	and then atom happened.
Jul 19 21:33:33 <t>	^
Jul 19 21:33:36 <SpaceNigger>	do people actually use sublime?
Jul 19 21:33:43 <SpaceNigger>	i thought everyone was just laughing at it
Jul 19 21:34:08 <springworm>	i think sublime is pretty good for most normal people
Jul 19 21:34:14 <t>	I love sublime, i do all my web development through it
Jul 19 21:34:20 <springworm>	and then people like to mock it because text editor flame wars
Jul 19 21:34:25 <SpaceNigger>	vim > *
Jul 19 21:34:28 <SpaceNigger>	well maybe not
Jul 19 21:34:37 <SpaceNigger>	vim is the nicest editor i have came accross for my needs
Jul 19 21:34:42 <t>	vi > *
Jul 19 21:34:49 <t>	FUCK!!
Jul 19 21:34:57 <t>	atom failed to build
Jul 19 21:35:08 <SpaceNigger>	it failed for me too
Jul 19 21:35:12 <SpaceNigger>	so i just gave atom a miss
Jul 19 21:35:34 <t>	atom is great once you have it
Jul 19 21:35:50 <t>	im not trying to switch from sublime but its a close rival
Jul 19 21:39:06 <Joom>	> Sublime Text may be downloaded and evaluated for free, however a license must be purchased for continued use.
Jul 19 21:39:10 <Joom>	> $70
Jul 19 21:39:14 <Joom>	why
Jul 19 21:41:16 <springworm>	i doubt very many people pay for it
Jul 19 21:41:23 <springworm>	because the evaluation period has no limit
Jul 19 21:42:14 <t>	a friend of mine bought a license and offered to let me use it
Jul 19 21:43:07 <springworm>	he paid $70 to remove the word "unlicensed" in the corner
Jul 19 21:44:10 <t>	but it also stops the popup you get on i think every 5th filesave
Jul 19 21:44:11 <Joom>	so it's winrar, the editor
Jul 19 21:44:26 <Joom>	surely it'd be easy to crack
Jul 19 21:44:36 <springworm>	oh there's a popup. see i didn't use it enough to have that happen
Jul 19 21:44:58 <t>	its just a "thanks for using sublime, consider paying for a license"
Jul 19 21:45:07 <Joom>	what kind of license is it?
Jul 19 21:45:12 <t>	its plain text
Jul 19 21:45:35 <t>	if it wasnt someone elses license id totally show you it
Jul 19 21:45:55 <Joom>	Sublime.Text.v2.0.2.2221.X64.Incl.Keygen.and.Patch-Lz0
Jul 19 21:45:57 <Joom>	no need
Jul 19 21:46:32 <t>	on a scale of easy to fuck it how hard was that
Jul 19 21:47:09 <Joom>	to find a release?
Jul 19 21:47:16 <t>	to crack it
Jul 19 21:49:01 <Joom>	Oh I didn't crack it. Lz0 did. I just searched a db. I'm about to take a look at their keygen.

Jul 20 21:44:11 <t>	he's a special white guy
Jul 20 21:45:12 <gaynigger>	That's racist.

Jul 20 21:57:31 <gaynigger>	could we go in there?
Jul 20 21:57:48 <CandyMan>	of course

Jul 20 22:00:10 <gaynigger>	CandyMan, truth be told though
Jul 20 22:00:13 <gaynigger>	I agree with stallman on this issue
Jul 20 22:00:21 <gaynigger>	I'm very sceptical about the concept of 'statutory rape'
Jul 20 22:00:40 <CandyMan>	what does that even mean?
Jul 20 22:00:46 <gaynigger>	I don't buy that human beings are the only mammals on the planet who for some reason get hormones going, start being able to reproduce, get a desire to have sex, but "aren't ready" yet for it.
Jul 20 22:00:57 <gaynigger>	It means it's automatically rape if you have sex with someone under 16 or something.
Jul 20 22:01:06 <CandyMan>	oh
Jul 20 22:01:07 <gaynigger>	Verbal consent is irrelevnat, supposedly because a child can't consent to sex.
Jul 20 22:01:10 <CandyMan>	well thats jsut bullshit
Jul 20 22:01:17 <CandyMan>	you are ready when the puberty hits
Jul 20 22:01:20 <gaynigger>	Of course, a child can't consent to being religiously indoctrinated either, but we'll just ignore that.
Jul 20 22:01:28 <gaynigger>	You're ready when you want it I feel.
Jul 20 22:02:02 <CandyMan>	"but muh brains are still developing". well brains aren't fully developed before age of ~25
Jul 20 22:08:43 <gaynigger>	Even that's a nonsenstical statement.
Jul 20 22:08:48 <gaynigger>	"developing brains" and stuff.
Jul 20 22:09:08 <gaynigger>	IT's not liek brains ever reach a stadium at which they are "complete" or something.
Jul 20 22:09:15 <CandyMan>	well yeah
Jul 20 22:09:27 <CandyMan>	but at puberty you grow more synapses or whatever they were called in english
Jul 20 22:11:29 <jmbi>	hell yea
Jul 20 22:12:24 <CandyMan>	purity fuck yeah

Jul 20 22:14:02 <Barcelona>	No way you're 15
Jul 20 22:14:09 <Joom>	he is
Jul 20 22:14:22 <Joom>	I helped troll his principal last year
Jul 20 22:14:28 <gaynigger>	CandyMan, that's a long jump to "still developing"
Jul 20 22:14:40 <gaynigger>	the other explanation is just that younger brains are more adaptive to new situations
Jul 20 22:14:55 <gaynigger>	which is definitely something that is corroborated by simple observation, children are more adaptive than adults in general.
Jul 20 22:15:05 <SpaceNigger>	what if christianity is just trolling people into not having sex
Jul 20 22:15:13 <gaynigger>	God is the biggest torll ver
Jul 20 22:15:16 <SpaceNigger>	yeah
Jul 20 22:15:26 <gaynigger>	He as like "let's create these puny ants in my image, give them ridiculous rules and see if they follow it."
Jul 20 22:15:37 <CandyMan>	gaynigger: well you need to be able to adapt at young age to survive
Jul 20 22:15:37 <Joom>	SpaceNigger, that can't be true since Catholicism condemns those that use condoms
Jul 20 22:15:47 <Joom>	that's why Mexicans have like 12 kids
Jul 20 22:15:48 <gaynigger>	And after 4000 years he got bored and then he appeared again to Christians and gave them a slightly different message, and 600 years later to Muslims
Jul 20 22:15:52 <SpaceNigger>	sex for reasons other than recreation
Jul 20 22:15:57 <SpaceNigger>	is immoral in the eyes of god
Jul 20 22:16:03 <gaynigger>	and now he'slike "Lol, they're all mad at each other even though I told thme exactly the same thing except for a few minor differences."
Jul 20 22:16:21 <Joom>	Don't you mean procreation?
Jul 20 22:16:26 <SpaceNigger>	yeah
Jul 20 22:16:29 <gaynigger>	Niggers don't have that kind of vocabulary.
Jul 20 22:16:35 <gaynigger>	Joom, do you know what the word quintessential means.

Jul 20 22:16:50 <gaynigger>	I read that only 1/5 Americans does.
Jul 20 22:17:10 <gaynigger>	Joom, CandyMan, the Finn, does not know what quintessential means.
Jul 20 22:17:28 <CandyMan>	I knew but I forgot
Jul 20 22:17:36 <gaynigger>	CandyMan, kerro Joomille että sä et tiedä mitä quintessential tarkoittaa
Jul 20 22:17:37 <Joom>	Most Americans that are surveyed are the ones that don't even know Hawaii is a state.
Jul 20 22:17:48 <CandyMan>	is Joom finnfag?

Jul 20 22:22:44 *	SpaceNig1 is now known as SpaceNigger
Jul 20 22:22:59 <lee>	Because obviously tiling is a nice automation, it now supports tiling
Jul 20 22:23:13 <lee>	The screen is broken up into a grid
Jul 20 22:23:27 <lee>	The grid grows as you move into other grids
Jul 20 22:23:43 <lee>	alt+o brings up a map
Jul 20 22:23:56 <lee>	I'm trying to implement a prototype in dwm
Jul 20 22:24:15 <jmbi>	do yourself a favor and implement in xcb first
Jul 20 22:24:33 <lee>	what don't you understand about "prototype" lol
Jul 20 22:24:59 <Barcelona>	It's because you are supposed to say alpha/beta
Jul 20 22:25:00 <lee>	I need to be paid basically to get my infinite desktop idea done properly in a good time period
Jul 20 22:25:21 <jmbi>	fuck prototyping
Jul 20 22:25:21 <lee>	otherwise it'll only ever be a paper
Jul 20 22:25:30 <lee>	I have no time lol
Jul 20 22:25:42 <lee>	Expect infinite desktop in 5 years
Jul 20 22:25:50 <jmbi>	maybe I can try
Jul 20 22:25:52 <Barcelona>	I think youngin is right
Jul 20 22:25:59 <Barcelona>	You have time
Jul 20 22:26:07 <jmbi>	just do it right the first time
Jul 20 22:26:14 <Barcelona>	But you're burning it all up now piddling on irc
Jul 20 22:26:14 <jmbi>	even if it takes longer
Jul 20 22:26:35 <lee>	Learning X is a pain
Jul 20 22:26:47 <SpaceNigger>	yeah
Jul 20 22:26:53 <SpaceNigger>	the api and protocol is fucking retarded
Jul 20 22:26:57 <Barcelona>	So basically you're making a wm, right?
Jul 20 22:26:58 <SpaceNigger>	and overcomplicated as hell
Jul 20 22:27:13 <lee>	I need to code a window manager from scratch- there are a hundred window managers, all that have taken years to even get 'good' functionality to make up for the downfalls in X
Jul 20 22:27:14 <Barcelona>	I mean, tinywm is like 50 lines
Jul 20 22:27:22 <lee>	tinywm does not work
Jul 20 22:27:35 <lee>	It doesn't even run properly in Xephyr
Jul 20 22:27:40 <Barcelona>	Well even ratpoison then is only a few lines
Jul 20 22:27:42 <lee>	So I gave up on using that as a base
Jul 20 22:27:48 <Barcelona>	what the hell is xephyr
Jul 20 22:27:51 <SpaceNigger>	lee: fork mcwm and clean it up
Jul 20 22:28:00 <lee>	I need something with: window resizing, moving, and mouse usage
Jul 20 22:28:06 <SpaceNigger>	or dwm, monstrwm-xcb or w/e
Jul 20 22:28:07 <lee>	and let me work from there
Jul 20 22:28:26 <Barcelona>	Okay
Jul 20 22:28:33 <Barcelona>	I'm not talking you down or anything
Jul 20 22:28:34 <lee>	tinywm would've been perfect if it fucking worked in Xephyr
Jul 20 22:28:34 <jmbi>	yeah, fork mcwm
Jul 20 22:28:38 <Barcelona>	But I really want to know
Jul 20 22:28:43 <Barcelona>	what is the point of this?\
Jul 20 22:28:52 <jmbi>	running X inside of X I think?
Jul 20 22:28:53 <lee>	a better desktop
Jul 20 22:29:03 <lee>	jmbi: it means my idea
Jul 20 22:29:07 <lee>	not Xephyr
Jul 20 22:29:07 <Barcelona>	yes jmbi I gathered that
Jul 20 22:29:24 <Barcelona>	lee: is it so you can tile groups of tiled windows?
Jul 20 22:29:40 <lee>	...no, because dwm already does that
Jul 20 22:29:43 <Barcelona>	Like rinning a xephyr in i3 that has i3 running in it?

Jul 20 22:30:09 <Barcelona>	Well I'm not seeing the point though
Jul 20 22:30:12 <lee>	I'm not going to restart X a million times
Jul 20 22:30:25 <lee>	Xephyr IS FOR TESTING THE WINDOW MANAGER
Jul 20 22:30:26 <Barcelona>	I understand that he needs it is why he is coding it
Jul 20 22:30:40 <lee>	Better user experience??
Jul 20 22:30:42 <Barcelona>	So what is the infinite desktop for?
Jul 20 22:30:44 <lee>	Why else
Jul 20 22:30:45 <Barcelona>	I mean
Jul 20 22:30:47 <Barcelona>	Like
Jul 20 22:30:51 <lee>	use cases?
Jul 20 22:30:56 <Barcelona>	Can you tell me why you want it?
Jul 20 22:31:05 <lee>	1) no window clutter, ever
Jul 20 22:31:08 <Barcelona>	Don't take offense, seriously
Jul 20 22:31:18 <lee>	Believe I've thought about why I want it
Jul 20 22:31:26 <Barcelona>	I know
Jul 20 22:31:33 <Barcelona>	I'm curious as to why though
Jul 20 22:31:33 <lee>	2) not restricted to tiny screen
Jul 20 22:31:48 <lee>	3) no being lost in multi desktop space
Jul 20 22:32:06 <lee>	4) only thing limiting is how big an int can be
Jul 20 22:32:25 <lee>	so it is theoretically infinite
Jul 20 22:32:51 <lee>	And there are ways around the int limit too
Jul 20 22:32:57 <lee>	But no one would want that
Jul 20 22:33:07 <lee>	10000x10000 desktop is probably all someone will ever need
Jul 20 22:33:31 <lee>	So there you have it

Jul 20 22:37:25 <Barcelona>	I guess I just can't understand what you mean
Jul 20 22:37:34 <Barcelona>	Are you coding from scratch?
Jul 20 22:46:32 <lee>	If I want to use something as a base, no
Jul 20 22:46:40 <lee>	unless you consider that from scratch
Jul 20 22:46:58 <lee>	IMO using something as a base is better because they have worked out a bunch of quirks that I'll encounter eventually

Jul 23 20:15:42 <pico>	Title: Joshua Fogg (at murder.pw)
Jul 23 20:15:48 <bwmc>	i went to the liberty of re-uploading your cv, just incase you lost it
Jul 23 20:25:57 <CandyMan>	gaynigger: neat
Jul 23 20:28:46 <gaynigger>	CandyMan, not as dark & edgy as usual though.
Jul 23 20:29:03 <gaynigger>	CandyMan, there's a proverb in Dutch "Hoe dichter bij de nul, hoe strakker om de lul." it sort of translates to "The closer to zero, the tighter around the cock."
Jul 23 20:29:04 <gaynigger>	discuss.
Jul 23 20:32:03 <CandyMan>	lol
Jul 23 20:32:32 <CandyMan>	I like more the one medieval quote, can't remember how it went exactly but I'll try to find it before I rape it
Jul 23 20:33:16 <gaynigger>	Foggalong, why did you ban bwmc?
Jul 23 20:34:28 <CandyMan>	"God lives the time. Humanity is created for only to die"
Jul 23 20:35:47 <gaynigger>	It's true
Jul 23 20:35:49 <gaynigger>	I never got that
Jul 23 20:35:53 <gaynigger>	Like, God is omnipotent right
Jul 23 20:36:01 <gaynigger>	from his perspective, that's normal, since he's the only thing that exists
Jul 23 20:36:12 <gaynigger>	Then he goes out to create puny little ants who can't do shit, and die of old age for whatever reason
Jul 23 20:36:16 <gaynigger>	He's basically creating insects
Jul 23 20:36:29 <gaynigger>	And he then gives them a set of rules to live by and says "Worship me, or go to hell."
Jul 23 20:36:33 <CandyMan>	everything we do is also meaningless
Jul 23 20:36:39 <CandyMan>	even spacetravel would be
Jul 23 20:36:39 <gaynigger>	Of course
Jul 23 20:36:41 <CandyMan>	breeding
Jul 23 20:36:48 <CandyMan>	nothing matters in the great cosmos
Jul 23 20:36:51 <gaynigger>	People who believe there"s a "purpose" to live are out of their mind.
Jul 23 20:36:55 <gaynigger>	to life*
Jul 23 20:37:01 <gaynigger>	Life is a coincidence, nothing more.
Jul 23 20:37:27 <CandyMan>	for what evolution exist anyway? who life forms try to survive when there is no goal?
Jul 23 20:37:33 <CandyMan>	why*
Jul 23 20:38:35 <CandyMan>	also one nice philosophist(how do you type that) said: we should stop breeding. why people think they have the right to create life that inevitably will be hurt
Jul 23 20:39:46 <Foggalong>	bwmc: nah, just moving servers
Jul 23 20:39:51 <CandyMan>	http://bookslive.co.za/blog/2009/03/05/podcast-and-review-ucts-david-benatar-says-better-never-to-have-been/
Jul 23 20:39:54 <Foggalong>	Should be back on in a while
Jul 23 20:39:56 <Foggalong>	But thanks!
Jul 23 20:40:01 <bwmc>	np
Jul 23 20:40:15 <CandyMan>	"Whenever you create a life, Benatar says, you are creating a being that can, and will, experience pain. "
Jul 23 20:44:49 <gaynigger>	CandyMan, you should play gookclick with me
Jul 23 20:44:54 <gaynigger>	the one true game that is not for filthy casuals
Jul 23 20:45:53 <bwmc>	Foggalong: i'm meeting a friend at the asda near walkley on friday
Jul 23 20:45:58 <bwmc>	wanna meet up and get blazed?
Jul 23 20:46:26 <CandyMan>	gaynigger: I suck at strategy games so much that they become tragedy games
Jul 23 20:47:04 <CandyMan>	I only play them like sims. like in empire earth I just build cities and killed weaklings
Jul 23 20:47:14 <CandyMan>	made peace with npc, build inside his area and killed him
Jul 23 20:47:54 <Foggalong>	bwmc: nah, not my thing
Jul 23 20:48:09 <bwmc>	damn
Jul 23 20:52:27 <Foggalong>	enjoy though

Jul 26 17:02:13 <bwmc>	how come Emily won't be my gf
Jul 26 17:02:15 <bwmc>	;_;
Jul 26 17:02:39 <Foggalong>	Probably because she's got a bf
Jul 26 17:03:15 <Foggalong>	And you're (probably) just a creepy guy on the internet
Jul 26 17:03:20 <Foggalong>	At least to her
Jul 26 17:03:50 <bwmc>	i'm only creepy on irc
Jul 26 17:04:12 <Foggalong>	I wish I could believe that.
Jul 26 17:04:52 <bwmc>	it's true
Jul 26 17:06:08 <Foggalong>	Two scenarios
Jul 26 17:06:30 <Foggalong>	a) You've actually messaged the sister of some randomer on the internet. That is creepy, and not on IRC.
Jul 26 17:06:46 <Foggalong>	b) You didn't do that, in which case you're a liar.
Jul 26 17:07:12 <Foggalong>	Either way, you look a bit shit
Jul 26 17:07:17 <Foggalong>	No offence
Jul 26 17:07:50 <bwmc>	but Joshua, you're not a randomer
Jul 26 17:07:52 <bwmc>	you're my friend
Jul 26 17:08:54 <Foggalong>	And I'm a cactus.
Jul 26 17:09:04 <Foggalong>	So I just don't think is going to work out
Jul 26 17:09:45 <bwmc>	i'm an expert at making things work out
Jul 26 17:09:52 <bwmc>	it will, don't you worry :)
Jul 26 17:10:36 <Foggalong>	I dunno, it's not really worked out so far
Jul 26 17:10:48 <bwmc>	it has for me, I know everything about you
Jul 26 17:10:50 <Foggalong>	And unless you have access to a suitable habitat for growing cacti
Jul 26 17:10:51 <bwmc>	and you know nothing about me
Jul 26 17:11:09 <Foggalong>	I don't need to - you mean literally nothing to me
