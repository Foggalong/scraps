# Surveys

Data from old survey I did, such as [this one](androidthemes14) for [r/androidthemes](https://pay.reddit.com/r/androidthemes/) in 2014. Old unixporn surveys are archived in their [own repo](https://github.com/unixporn/surveys).

Summary graphics and scripts for analysis are licensed under the GPL v3+; everything else is not. Most all of this data was collected and put here for storing pre-GDPR. If you have an issue with some of your identifiable personal data which is stored in this repository, please contact me.
