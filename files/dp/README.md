# Democracy Project

These are the remaining files of the Democracy Project, an ill fated I had to create an icon theme whose design decisions were all made by a democratic vote. This built on [Numix](https://github.com/numixproject) and made no changes that aren't already archived there, but this folder includes the underlying infrastructure. There's a copy of the constitution, a voter register, an unused ban register, a copy of the logo, and the program that I used to automate emails.
