# First RPG

As part of following [LPTHW](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) I tried to create a very simple grid-walking text-based RPG. It wasn't very polished, but it was a lot of fun. I later tried to build on these ideas with an [Animal Crossing Text Adventure](https://github.com/Foggalong/Animal-Crossing-Text-Adventure) but never finished that.
