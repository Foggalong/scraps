"""
This is program which checks whether a given script passes
the Betchel test. The requirements to pass the test are:

    1. The cast must contain at least 2 females
    2. Two females must at some point have a conversation
    3. The conversation cannot be about a male

A derived test (Mako Mori) also has too additional conditions
which will serve here as bonus points:

    4. One female has their own narrative arc
    5. The arc is not about supporting a maleâ€™s story
    
For this program scripts which fufil 1, 2, and 3 will be
given as "Pass", those which then pass 4 will be given a
"Merit", and those which pass all 5 are marked "Distinction".
    
While these requirements are not by any means the definition
of a good script they are an interesting measure of how male
dominated a piece of media can be.

To use the program run it in the same directory as the
script with the command "./betchel.py script.txt". Please
not that to get accurate results from the script you may
have to modify some of the config variables below.
