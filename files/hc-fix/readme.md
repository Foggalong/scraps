These are two abandoned versions of the [hardcode fixer](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer/tree/master) script. The development version was moved to scrap because in most cases it wasn't used. The python version was moved to scrap because it's maintainer stopped maintaining it and it fell too far behind the main release. I don't have time to maintain too versions, but if someone comes along and wants to pick it up they're more than welcome to do so.
