Development Versions
==============
### fix-d.sh
This script has all the experimental features that need further testing before they are pushed to the "stable" version. Examples would be adding a new mode or a significant change to the file structure of the data system. These development releases will not be announced in the release tracker but instead just be available here for anyone who wants to give it a try.

### fix.py
Until v0.3 the fixing script was written in python, but it quickly became unruly and so was dropped for a rewrite in bash. Fast forward to v0.8 and one of the contributors, Tom van der Lee, went back to the drawing board and rewrote the whole thing again in python and the result was quite astounding. While not as full featured as the bash version, it's shorter, more efficient and avoided a lot of the permissions issues that arose with bash. It's undecided what the future will be for the python version but for now it can be found here for those who wish to try it.
