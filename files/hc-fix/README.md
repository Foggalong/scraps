# Hardcode Fixer

I do/did develop a [tool for fixing hardcoded icons](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer) in linux. Here are some additional utilities which were used for maintaining theme support lists, now a deprecated feature. Previously here also was a Python rewrite of the whole project Tom van der Lee (<t0m.vd.l33@gmail.com>) which I've since removed - it's not my scrap to share.
