# Cipher Challenge

In 2011/12 and 2012/22 I took part in the University of Southampton's [Cipher Challenge](https://www.cipherchallenge.org/). Inspired by one of my friends, [Ben Ward](https://github.com/bward), with my team I tried to solve as many of these in Python as possible. These were collated in a single project `brutus`, but it was _not_ a well organised project owing to the fact that I was self-teaching Python alongside it.

There are also some Excel-based solvers, the original basis of which was written by one of my maths teachers Mr Robinson.
