# The Wiki Game

This was an idea for a game being developed for a Numix app. The basic premise was that you would be given a jumbled series letters along with a clue for what the unjumbled phrase was. The problem that we ran into was that because each game was so quick we'd need 100s if not 100s of these phrases & clues which would be way too labour intensive to do manually. I developed a proof-of-concept game in Python which uses random Wikipedia articles to get the random phrase and then uses the first line of that article as the clue. This worked brilliantly but the conundrums it created were incredibly difficult to solve. Eventually Numix went with another app idea and this one was shelved. I might come back to it some day and implement some sort of difficulty slider based on the popularity of the article, but until then it'll stay here in scraps.
