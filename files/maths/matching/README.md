# Stable Matching Problem

One of the masters projects I applied for but didn't get was on the [stable matching problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem). I spent the summer learning about the problem and existing algorithms for solving it, part of which included creating this script for solving them in Python. There are some other resources I made around this but not sure where they ended up.
